I'm Catholic, I never had a car or real dating money until my early 30s, my parents NEVER encouraged dating or relationships for me or my siblings (6 of us in all), no girls ever showed any interest in me, I was shy, and to some extent my family was dysfunctional and emotionally barren.<br /><br />I've had 5 dates in my life, and all of them were a waste of time. They were emotionally traumatizing since I started so late, I had no clue as to how to behave. None of the people I ever wanted to see again.<br /><br />Being celibate is not the WORST thing that can happen to you. In my case I developed a mild porno addiction and used masturbation since 15 to satisfy my lustful feelings. Today most of that is gone. I find most women simply don't like men today. Once you get past 30-35, if you are still single, it was probably what God intended for you.<br /><br />Sadly some of us just won't get any offers for intimacy and we may also lack the skills to get anyone interested in us as well. Read the book Save the Males. I learned to accept what happened to me, and I'm glad I'm not stuck with kids I didn't want or a marriage I don't enjoy. Many married people have told me repeatedly I'm lucky to be single and not to change it now.<br /><br />I'll never know until death it this was God wanted for me or not. It's happened, and all I can do is deal with it one day at a time. There is no fairness in the dating world, and lots of fine people just won't land a partner.

I know a couple of girls who do everything BUT sexual intercourse in order to technically remain virgins. I can sadly understand why they do this. I grew up in a Mexican household were I was given a lot of mixed messages on the issue of virginity. My dad was pretty open minded. My mom, on the other hand, pretended to be open about it (she would tell me I was free to have sex) but labeled girls who lost their virginity before marriage as \"whores.\"<br /><br />That certainly has contributed to the confused state of mind I now have. A part of me wants to remain a virgin until I get marry while the other simply doesn\u2019t. Nevertheless, I am conscious that virginity does not define nor does it make a woman any better.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Why have you decided to stay a virgin?</span><br />Well, I never officially decided to remain a virgin. I never had a boyfriend or been in a situation were I was close to losing my virginity, so it\u2019s been easy pretty easy to stay a virgin.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How have your dates/partners reacted?</span><br />I've only been to a couple of dates so I never had to confess I was a virgin. I have only confessed that I\u2019m a virgin to a limited number of people at my uni and they all acted pretty surprised. I had been told that I simply don\u2019t look like a virgin because I am \"attractive\" and quite flamboyant. I don\u2019t know whether to feel flattered or not about this.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Anything else you want to say about virginity or our cultural attitudes towards it?</span><br />I wish that I could honestly say that I embrace and love the fact I am a virgin, but to be honest I don\u2019t. I feel ashamed that I am a virgin who has never even been in a relationship. I remember sitting in art class one day and the issue of sexuality arising. A guy said that he was not going to censor himself because everybody in class had sex, or something along those lines.<br /><br />Although I understand that most college students are not virgins, label me crazy but I felt embarrassed. It is as if once you reach a certain age you are expected to have sex and if you don\u2019t then you are a loser. For now, I plan to solely focus on my studies and hopefully the right guy will show up someday.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);\">Tell us how you define virginity, how you lost/kept it, and anything else about the v-word.

I do believe oral/anal are a form of sex, i.e. one couldn't claim to be abstinent if they partook in any of these acts.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How I lost mine:</span><br />I always thought that was a strange way of phrasing the question... as if virginity was something that I posses and that somebody will eventually take away from me...<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Anyway, my story:</span><br />Just after I turned 16 I had met a man... an older man, he was 34 to be exact. Growing up, I had a bad relationship with my father, so when an older man was willing to give me some attention and make me feel special, it was hard to resist even though I knew the situation was really wrong. I knew I was being taken advantage of, but it was nice to feel wanted.<br /><br />The first time we had sex was a very strange experience. Most of it was the feeling of just wanting to get it over with, both in the psychological and physical sense. I just remember it being horrendously painful to the point where I was nearly crying and wanting it to be over. <span>However, once I crossed that line I couldn't help but feel used, as if I was now officially \"damaged goods\".</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Why we need to talk about virginity:</span><br />I think this project of yours takes a very interesting look at how our society views virginity. <span>It seems to be something that is revered yet not something you want to brag about.</span> I know my friends hate telling guys that they are virgins because most guys either don't want to be the one to \"take it\" or they are way too aroused by the idea of it.<br /><br />Additionally, I wanted to share my story since most often <span>between t.v., movies, and magazines, losing your virginity is this romanticized event, yet I'm sure most women have stories that range from lack luster to disturbing.</span> Personally, I feel like I can't tell my story to people because they'll look at me differently or think ill of me for losing mine how I did.<br /><br />I'm 21 now, and I still feel conflicted with how I lost mine... a part of me is really glad it's over, another part wants to forget the whole thing, and another really wishes it could have been a more pleasant experience.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);\">Tell us how you define virginity, how you lost/kept it, and anything else about the v-word.

I always thought of the loss of virginity as vaginal penetration.  In reality, though, I don't see losing your virginity as an all-or-nothing thing.  There are different stages of sexual activity, and it's just my personal preference to put the virginity line there.  I think the cliched baseball analogy actually works well, with the whole \"second base/third base\" progression.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Why have you decided to stay a virgin?</span>I'm still a virgin for a few reasons.  When I was younger, I didn't really want to have sex until I was in a relationship.  As I got older, I decided to at least wait until I get to know someone first.  Now, I'd have sex with a cute stranger if I wasn't worried about disease.<br /><br />But all of this is moot, because I've never really had the opportunity to have sex.  I've always been shy and withdrawn, and when I hit puberty I developed a serious case of depression and social anxiety.  This turned normal teenage relationship angst into a terrifying feeling of paralysis.  And it was at its worst during high school and college, when most people are starting to begin their sex lives.<br /><br />I don't think I'm unattractive, but I'm also not particularly attractive.  I was a skinny nerd in school and never really did anything to draw attention to myself.  I asked a couple girls out in high school, and they said \"Yes\" but didn't mean it.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How have your dates/partners reacted?</span>It wasn't until my second year of college that I had a sexual experience at all. I was studying in England and became friends with a cute girl named Anna.  I noticed that she seemed to pay more than friendly attention to me, and I was mutually interested.  I was too terrified to act, so she took the initiative and for my last two weeks in England, we slept together a few times.  We didn't have intercourse, and I'm still not sure exactly why -- except that I wouldn't do it without a condom, and I didn't have one.<br /><br />Going out and getting a condom would have seemed a natural solution, but I guess it just never occurred to me.  As it was, I was thrilled with what was happening.  My self-esteem experienced a surge from her.  That, and she had a special talent for fellatio.  I can't speak from experience, naturally, but I think I actually had multiple orgasms.  I certainly had two back-to-back that I will remember until the day I die.<br /><br />That's how it went.  She went down on me, I went down on her.  I tried to be especially attentive during oral sex, but then I guess most insecure guys are. It became obvious that she was just having fun, but I actually liked her.  We were both American students in England, but when school started back, we'd be back together in the same city.  I realized that she wasn't really interested in pursuing it.  And she wasn't.<br /><br />Since then, I've gone out on dates with four or five girls, but none of them have ever turned into anything.  The closest I came to sex since then was one night I spent with a girl named Sarah.  She stayed at my place and wanted to have sex, but she was having her period.  A few months after that, I starting seeing a girl named Jen, but she had just gotten out of a relationship and didn't want any commitment at all beyond making out on my couch.  She never really broke up with me; she just stopped calling, didn't return my messages, and I got the point.<br /><br />Now I'm 28 and worried desperately that the clock is ticking for me.  I know that people can have sex after 30, but I don't like my odds.  I'm not in great shape, my social anxiety still keeps me from talking to people, and I'm going bald.  I'm also insecure and desperate, and neither of things are considered turn-ons.  It's funny, because I'm not insecure sexually, really; just the fact that I'm so inexperienced.  I'm not hugely well-endowed, but I'm well above-average.  My stamina seemed fine during oral sex, and I think I'm at least somewhat good at it myself, or else that girl Anna was a good actress.  It's just the simple inter-personal things that you do to build a relationship -- or just to get laid -- that I can't master.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Anything else you want to say about virginity or our cultural attitudes towards it?</span>There is just so much SEX out there in the world and so many ways to remind you that you're not having it.  The perception is that everyone ELSE is doing it.  It's a false perception, but it's still pretty convincing if you're insecure.<br /><br />I dare not tell anyone that I'm still a virgin.  Most people assume I'm not, since I'm freakin' 27, and if the topic does come up, I say that I did it once.  But the worst thing is admitting it to myself.  Because logically, I know that other people aren't judging me nearly as much as I judge myself.  And that lack of confidence has a cyclical effect, decreasing my attractiveness and becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.<br /><br />I'm sure things aren't as bad for me as they seem.  All of my female friends assure me that I'm going to find someone someday (although that's just half a sentence; the other half is \"but it won't be me\").  But the fact that I've had such poor luck with women -- and been treated poorly even by those who didn't turn me down -- just makes me wonder if I won't end up as a 50-year-old \"confirmed bachelor\" who teaches literature at a small private school and then goes home and cries into his Chardonnay.<br /><br />But thanks for the website; it's nice for us virgins to have somebody else to hear from.  And it's good to know that there are more of us out there than Madison Avenue would have us believe.  And maybe someday being a nerdy, but loving guy will be the new fashion.

I consider myself \u2018heteroflexible,\u2019 primarily attracted to males but not opposed to the idea of being with a women. I come from a conservative catholic family and we don\u2019t talk about sex ever. I never even got a \u2018use protection\u2019 talk or \u2018wait till your married\u2019 talk and to this day wonder if my parents ever suspect I\u2019ve had sex. Away from my family I\u2019m much more liberal and open minded about sex and even recently started a blog about various things including sex.<br /><br /><b>What is your definition of virginity?</b><br />Since I have many GLBTQ friends I know the \u2018penis in a vagina\u2019 definition is not a good one for everyone, however if I had to define it in concrete terms for me and other heteronormal couples I would say sex is either vaginal or anal penetration with the penis. Using tampons and sex toys doesn't count, and I don't think anal sex is a loop hole. I gave oral sex before having sex and still considered myself a virgin at that point, although I know for many people that\u2019s a gray area.<br /><br /><b>Why did you decide to stay a virgin?</b><br />I never decided to stay a virgin till married, however I also always knew it was something I wanted to be special, and I didn\u2019t want to lose it during a one night stand but at least to someone I was in a safe long term and loving relationship with eve if they weren't 'The One'. I was frustrated because for quite awhile I felt like a very sexual person and was ready to sex, but wasn\u2019t able to maintain a serious relationship long enough to be comfortable with them. Some of the guys I dated left after finding out my number was 0 and realizing I wouldn\u2019t get ready to have sex for awhile. But I wasn\u2019t ready to have casual sex like many of my friends.<br /><br /><b>When did you lose your virginity?</b><br />It\u2019s hard to explain but I think of 3 different times when I think of losing my virginity. My first sexual experience was sadly date rape from a slightly older \u2018mentor\u2019 student during my freshman year of college. While at his house he drugged me, then took me back to my room, and had sex with me. I only remember unpleasant flashes of it but I know he penetrated me, thus according to my own definition taking my virginity. However, I never consented and after recovering from the incident I found I continued to identify as a virgin, partly because I didn\u2019t even feel attached to my body at the time. However, I still struggled with the idea that he may have taken my \u2018technical\u2019 virginity.<br /><br />Later I began dating someone and eventually felt ready to have consensual sex and truly lose my virginity to him both physically and spiritually. However he had some health problems and we were never able to consecrate the act fully due to problems on his part which prevented any penetration, yet I had be willing and we had tried several times so I felt that I had \u2018given\u2019 some part of myself to him, perhaps my \u2018spiritual\u2019 virginity.<br /><br />Eventually when dating someone else it finally happened, we had actual penetrative sex that I agreed to. The first time was a little awkward and mechanical and just sex, but later it became making love. I told him the previous stories, and for the most part I believe we both consider him my first, just with a tiny asterisk next to it (in conversation I find myself saying, \"John Smith with my first... sort of\"). Generally I think of this is the \u2018true\u2019 time I lost my virginity.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Anything else you want to say about virginity?</span><br />In the end I think it\u2019s everyone\u2019s right to define sex and virginity as they want. I also have no problem with people who want (safe) casual sex. I just know for me sex is special and tied to emotions very strongly, a not just something physical my body is doing. Each time I \u2018lost it\u2019 I went through some difficult emotionally changes, partly because a word I had define a part of myself as my entire life was now gone. At times I wish my first time was all magical, in a field of flowers and ending in 5 multiple orgasms like I was lead to believe, but I don\u2019t regret it. It was what it was, I can\u2019t change it, and it has lead me to where I am now, having sex with some I love, and it truly has deepened and enhanced our bond in unimaginable ways.", "tags": [57, 21, 64, 63, 51, 34, 62, 61, 16, 60, 5, 59, 58, 1, 46], "maxage": 21, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2009/08/first-person-lilith-i-lost-my-virgnity-three-different-times/", "date": "2009-08-17", "definition": "there is technical virginity, spiritual virginity and making love", "aboutyou": ""}}, {"pk": 13, "model": "firstperson.story", "fields": {"firstgraf": "This week's First Person interview comes from 28-year-old Matt Higgins, an American journalist based in Indonesia .

On top of being a virgin, I've never been kissed and haven't managed so much as one date in the past 10 years.<br />\n<br />\nMind you, that's not a plea for help or an attempt to foist blame for my situation on others (like those truly frightening <a href=\"http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2009/08/05/true-forced-loneliness\">YouTube videos</a> Dan Savage linked to recently). My foibles are my own and of my own doing. I knew back in high school that being a reporter at a daily newspaper would entail long, strange hours and likely preclude any chance at a social life, and yet years down the road, here I am, still in the game.<br />\n<br />\nWhy? Because this is what stirs my passions. Staring at a blank page every day with the chance to create, inform and entertain is still irresistible. My profession may not last forever \u2013 heck, it might not make it to the end of the month at this rate \u2013 but as long as I have this, I'm OK with being alone. When it's gone? Well....<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How do you define virginity?</span><br />\nEvery person, it seems, has their own line of demarcation. In my mind, you relinquish your V-Card upon consensual vaginal or anal penetration (if, however, it is taken against your wishes, a mulligan is more than justified).<br />\n<br />\nOral sex isn't quite as cut and dried. It is a form of sex, but I can understand how one might still consider themselves a virgin despite having engaged in oral. As long as it's done in moderation (37? In a row?), I see no problem with that.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Why have you decided to stay a virgin?</span><br />\nIt wasn't so much a decision as it was just how things played out. I voluntarily gave up my nights and weekends when I got into the business, and having mostly worked on smaller staffs, pulling six-day and/or 50- to 60-hour work weeks is not uncommon. When you work while everyone else plays, it's hard to be social.<br />\n<br />\nLately, I've been wondering if I'm not social because I work so much, or is it I work so much because I'm not social? I've never been good with small talk (I much prefer to listen and then ask questions \u2013 shocking for someone in my line of work), and things like flirting and body language are utterly lost on me. At least when I'm interviewing someone, I have a clear, defined goal of getting the other person to open up and express more than just the usual yes/no/basic facts responses. As long as I have that goal in mind, I can do what I need to do without coming across as a complete nebbish.<br />\n<br />\nOnce I lose that, though, and I'm on my own in a social situation, things \u2013 as Lewis Black would say \u2013 take a turn. A reporter who manages to survive and thrive despite a complete lack of social acumen ... I'm not sure whether that's hilarious or sad.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Any special plans or ideas for losing it?</span><br />\nNot really. I used to tell myself that waiting for marriage would be my way of retaining my honor and showing my prospective bride that I thought so highly of her that I was willing to wait however long it might take to find her.<br />\n<br />\nThat, perhaps not surprisingly, turns out to be bunk. Most women \u2013 or at least the intelligent, strong, capable ones to whom I am attracted \u2013 don't want a white knight riding to their rescue on a shimmering steed. They want a similarly intelligent, fully formed man who is confident and comfortable in his own skin. Being a \"Nice Guy\" just means they don't run screaming at your presence, and keeping yourself \"pure\" in anticipation of the already over-hyped Wedding Night doesn't mean jack \u2013 especially if you don't have anything interesting to talk about in the awkward silence that will inevitably follow.<br />\n<br />\n**Ahem** Sorry, got a little rant-y there. Where was I? Ah, yes \u2013 not really. If it happens, odds are you won't hear me complaining. If not, I'll know why. I'll just keep stumbling along while my peers all stay conversant in the Things You Should Know About Dating By Now (TM).<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How have your dates/partners reacted?</span><br />\nYou can count the number of people I've told about my virginity on one hand. Reactions have varied from mild surprise (\"I didn't know people still did that.\") to dismissiveness (\"Then you got no chance with me, buster.\") to the old stand-by (\"I just assumed you were gay.\").<br />\n<br />\nMy family does not fit into that one hand, incidentally. My two younger siblings and I never had any of The Talks (drugs, sex, etc.) \u2013 when asked, our parents' response was always, \"You're smart. You'll figure it out.\" I don't feel compelled to share this with them, and none of my friends are close enough to where I'd feel comfortable sharing such information ... perhaps that's why this all flows forth so easily on the Interwebs.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Anything else you want to say about virginity?</span><br />\nMoving to Indonesia gave me a whole new perspective on virginity and women's issues as a whole. One of the first stories I read when I arrived was about how women were now allowed to serve as police officers ... provided they kept up with their cooking, sewing and beauty classes and passed their monthly virginity checks (!). The only thing that stunned me more than that revelation was how everyone around me just took it as a matter of course. I thought of myself as open-minded and sympathetic to the cause of women before, but seeing the way women and girls here are subjugated now makes me viscerally angry.<br />\n<br />\nAs for virginity: This may sound odd, coming as it does at the end of all this yodeling, but it's really not that big of a deal -- or at least it shouldn't be. Whether or not your genitalia have carnal knowledge of another set of genitalia has next to no bearing on your status as a person. The sooner people wrap their heads around that, the sooner we can move on to something important \u2013 like the lack of communication and emotional intimacy that persists despite people having more ways to speak to each other than ever before.<br />\n<br />\nI've gone 28 years without sex, and I imagine I can wait a while longer. What I don't want to miss, though, is that emotional intimacy, that feeling of being able to implicitly love and trust someone else and have them feel likewise toward you. That's probably a trickier and more time-consuming pursuit, but it's also more rewarding than worrying about who's stuck what in whom and how often.", "tags": [38, 57, 30, 21, 39, 10, 33, 26, 9, 25, 6, 24, 67, 3, 23, 2, 66, 65, 1], "maxage": 28, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2009/08/first-person-matt-moving-to-indonesia-gave-me-a-whole-new-perspective-on-virginity/", "date": "2009-08-24", "definition": "consensual vaginal or anal penetration", "aboutyou": "I am a 28-year-old, heterosexual male \u2013 born and bred in the American Midwest but moved to Southeast Asia to cling to the dream of working in newspapers.

I don't feel that me remaining a virgin this long is something I would've chosen if not for the assault. I have a natural respect for sex itself and I'm quite open in talking about it and exploring it (with myself) but a whole bunch of neuroses I'm usually not aware I have come into play when the chance to explore it with someone else pops up. I have no problems being friends with guys (especially because of how hard I am to offend) but it becomes a different thing all together when the issue of sex comes up.<br />\n<br />\nI think there's so much media focus on sex that it seems impossible to live without it, but I view it as a bit of a hype phenomenon.

When a person said he/she lost his/her virginity, it means that the person lost his/her first time by having sexual intercourse with another person. In other words, a virgin is a person who does not have any sexual experience with another person.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Why have you decided to stay a virgin?</span><br />Virginity is very important for Chinese, especially female. If a person married with person who is not virgin, it will drop their family reputation. I'm still a virgin. Why I choose to be virgin? Virginity is just like balloon, one poke and it's gone. Why I don't keep it for my beloved one? It is so precious. Giving it to a stranger or just friend, what if you pregnant? Condom? Condom only 99%, you still have a chance to get pregnant. If get pregnant, my dreams will gone. And who is going to be responsible for the baby? What about STD (Sexually Transmitted Diseases)? These<br />diseases usually transmit via free sex. If after marriage, it means you will go for a body check-up before marriage. It is safer. But what if premarital sex? You do not ask the person: \"Hey, if you want to have sex with me, go for check up first and bring the report to me.\" Do you say that?? Stay virgin is actually a way to protect myself and my future partner.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How have your dates/partners reacted?</span><br />Hey, if you love me, you have to respect me. If you already manage to stay with me forever, why can't you wait until the day we married? Love doesn't have to show through sex.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Any special plans or ideas for losing it?</span><br />My first marriage night. It's gonna be so memorable and sweet. Because I lost it for a person who loves me and will take care of me. Romantic. We waited so long just for that day to come. Get married, first sex to each other and have our own family.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Anything else you want to say about virginity?</span><br />Sex couldn't last forever, when you get older, you can't afford for that. But true love will make life better. I believe life without sex could be happy and enjoy too. I had attend a workshop about<br />virginity. The only way to protect yourself, not getting pregnant or STD,  is only abstinence. It works for 100% safety. Sometimes, virginity is a good instrument to test who really cares and loves you. Let's say, one guy come to you and say he loves you, you are the only one for him, could you have sex with him. Well, if you say no, I want to save my virginity until I married and he just hates you for that, he is not sincere to you. Oppositely, he accepts and is willing to wait until the big day.

I classify myself as a pansexual, but I am very rarely attracted to anyone. So far it's been three males, two females, and one androgynous beauty at the local bookstore. I have no idea whether s/he was male or female, and really didn't care.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How do you define virginity?</span><br />\nI don't know that I'd classify oral sex as sex, but it's a question I wrestle with, especially when it comes to lesbian sex. I think the definition of virginity is going to depend on the virgin (or non-virgin) you ask. The entire concept of virginity, particularly the idea that it needs a definite definition in social usage, seems strange to me. We don't have a word for the first time we join a mosh pit or write a novel or eat caviar, unless we actually use \"virgin\" in some way for it.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Why did you decide to stay a virgin/How did you lose virginity?</span><br />\nI stayed a virgin for 22 years because I was never sexually attracted to anyone. I've always been free and easy about sex as far as other people concerned, and I assumed I'd die a contented virgin, possibly in a stereotypical house full of cats. I rarely even masturbated.<br />\n<br />\nWhen I was 21 I met a guy who changed all that. The interest wasn't just sexual, but that was a big part of it \u2013 it was like all those pheromones I'd missed my entire adult life had concentrated down into one individual. I loved him emotionally as well, but I knew it would never be reciprocated (total incompatibility).<br />\n<br />\nI decided I wanted to lose my virginity with him, on the assumption that I might never want to get laid again. I felt so unattractive and insecure about myself that for a year I buckled down and lost 75 pounds. Most people would say I did that for him, but I did it for myself so that I wouldn't spend that time hating myself for how I looked.<br />\n<br />\nI called him up one day and said I might just show up and proposition him one day, and that's what I did. I was nervous, but not during the act \u2013 although I was self-conscious enough to keep my shirt on.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How have your partners reacted?</span><br />\nThe first guy was extremely nervous, despite having been with other women, even other virgins. I don't think men are used to women treating their virginity cavalierly, and I also think he was aware that I cared vastly more about him than he did about me. <span>I didn't feel like I was \"giving him a gift,\" or whatever BS term gets applied to it. I would have poured the same amount of emotional energy into it whether it was my first time or my fiftieth.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span>The only other man I've ever been with I was mildly attracted to (being attracted to one person opened the gates a little, I guess). I felt like I'd been cheating on my first, although he was by now hundred of miles away and we hadn't spoken in months. I've dated or flirted with guys since and accidentally led them on, only to shy away before sex was initiated.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Any general thoughts on virginity in our society?</span><br />\nI've always found the hymen concept perplexing and I feel alienated from the way virginity is perceived. I hate the idea that virginity something sacred, because the same idea rarely applies to men, and that means they get to collect something rare and lovely that we only have once.", "tags": [85, 84, 20, 78, 9, 34, 61, 47, 83, 82, 5, 58, 2, 81, 1, 80, 46], "maxage": 23, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2009/11/first-person-ashleyi-decided-i-wanted-to-lose-my-virginity-with-him-on-the-assumption-that-i-might-never-want-to-get-laid-again/", "date": "2009-11-12", "definition": "depends on the virgin , the entire concept seems strange to me.

Many guys talk about Friday from 5pm to early Monday morning being one long porn movie. The guys who don't participate in the bravado are looked upon as unmanly, gay or inexperienced.<br />\n<br />\nBeing tight-lipped will get you this reputation. This is a form of sexual harassment many men must endure that really isn't talked about in society. Even if they lose their virginity at 18, they will hear boasting in the locker room at 16 and feel either left out or try to make something up to fit in.<br />\n<br />\nMost of this bragging is about status and power. It's kind of like someone driving an SUV to \"prove\" they have value. You can see in many of the posts of older male virgins the cruelty they have been subjected to. There is inequity and power play between the haves/have nots.<br />\n<br />\nI remember other males boasting about sex. My feelings were very different. Even though I love sex there were and are many awkward moments. You'll never hear a guy bragging about the difficulty about getting a condom on, awkwardness about different positions, trouble getting in there or sliding out in the throes of passion, coming too soon etc...<br />\n<br />\nIronically, I didn't feel more masculine/powerful after losing my virginity. First time was awkward and I was happy to have it over with, like finishing finals at school. I did not have any male friends to discuss the experience with. Obviously I did not discuss with my family. I did not have any contact with the girl afterwards.<br />\n<br />\nI felt that skydiving was more of a step towards manhood and realized that I had done something most men and woman will never try. This is somewhat elitist, I also somehow feel more \"experienced\" when discussing the use of psychedelic drugs to someone who has never tried.<br />\n<br />\nNow I realize I have ranted....<br />\n<br />\nI was trying to get to the point that sexuality is a measure of power in some circles. It seems that sex is easily had via prostitutes/one night stands etc. Though I have indulged in this lifestyle without guilt or serious consequences, I do not recommend it.<br />\n<br />\nNow something much rarer is love and acceptance. The only human who loved me was my long-gone grandmother. Most people try in vain to find this in relationships.... My parents had a bitter marriage. The virgins fear they are missing out on sex and closeness to another. My experience is the sex part is easy, the closeness part I might not have in this life.<br />\n<br />\nThere is an excellent G'N'R video where Axl Rose comes off a bus stop with a straw of hay in his mouth; presumably coming from a small town where he had no friends and his family misunderstood him.

I'm studying Physics and French. I was raised LDS (Mormon), and I still live in Utah. I fall somewhere along the Jack Mormon to agnostic to liberal Christian spectrum. I've had a serious boyfriend since I was 18.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How do you define virginity?</span><br />\nMy first reaction would be to think of penetrative sex as being the line, but I see good arguments for the line being elsewhere.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Why did you decide to stay a virgin?</span><br />\nWell, here in \"Zion,\" sometimes that choice is made for you! (Har har.) In high school, I had absolutely no physical contact with the opposite sex: this came from a combination of studious nerdiness, pre-pubescence, and strict standards for myself. I mean, I hadn't even held hands!<br />\n<br />\nWhen I went down to Brigham Young University, I hit adolescence (I'm a late bloomer) and went boy-crazy. I made out with my first boyfriend a lot, but with the proscriptions against being in bedrooms and such, we always kept our clothes on. A different boyfriend I was very crazy about had insane amounts of self-control: we would only kiss. The third guy I dated/was engaged to, we went as far as oral sex, but held out a surprisingly long time (a couple of years). The more disaffected I became with the Church, the more I would do.<br />\n<br />\nAnd, though it's a bit embarrassing, I attempted to lose my virginity completely with the fianc\u00e9. Well, truth be told, he is now my ex-fianc\u00e9. We had a very sexual relationship, but no, I did not lose my virginity, as I would define that. We attempted to do so, but literally were not successful. (I think there\u2019s definitely a myth out there that once you know the mechanics of sex, it will somehow be easy or a no-brainer in practice! I\u2019m not stupid: I know how to have intercourse in theory: but it simply didn\u2019t happen on the first try.)<br />\n<br />\nThat experience was perhaps somewhat disappointing, but not terribly scarring\u2013I was perfectly willing to just \"have at it\" again. But then we broke up (over completely non-sexual reasons), so I don\u2019t know if I will \"wait till marriage\" now. I think once you\u2019re engaged to someone, obviously you picture having sex with them and no one else. So, I highly doubt it will \"live up to my expectations;\" at this point, though, I\u2019m more concerned with the loss of emotional intimacy.<br />\n<br />\nMy sexual life outside intercourse per se has been perfectly satisfying. Let\u2019s just say that I have a hard time comprehending these women that have never experienced an orgasm! But I think that comes down to society\u2019s bias against other forms of sexuality.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How have your partners reacted?</span><br />\nAll of my partners thus far have been LDS, and thus did not want to have sex before marriage. They were just as much virgins as me!<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Any general thoughts on virginity in our society?</span><br />\nI have a very high sex drive, and I think it's silly that even secularists act like women aren't sensual, are too \"tired\" all the time, etc., etc. Also, even though I no longer believe in a Prophet telling me when to say \"no,\" that doesn't mean I'm just going to jump in bed with any schmuck, you know? I still believe in standards, just those that are more self-determined at this point.<br />\n<br />\nAs far as virginity in the LDS society, I still do think that you should wait to have sex with a person you truly know and love, but that it is a pretty weak/unreliable determiner of your \"righteousness.\" If you constantly tell someone that something is bad, then they'll develop unhealthy complexes, male or female.", "tags": [69, 57, 37, 13, 28, 51, 62, 11, 34, 88, 87, 6, 47, 5, 56, 58, 3, 1, 46, 54], "maxage": 22, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2010/01/first-person-julieall-of-my-partners-thus-far-have-been-lds-they-were-just-as-much-virgins-as-me/", "date": "2010-01-25", "definition": "penetrative sex is the line", "aboutyou": ""}}, {"pk": 26, "model": "firstperson.story", "fields": {"firstgraf": "From time to time, we run a First Person culled from our comments section.

This is just my own personal definition however, because it obviously excludes other situations for people of varying sexual identities.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story:</strong><strong><br />\n</strong><br />\n<br />\nWhen I was younger, I had every intention of waiting until I was married to have sex with my husband. As I\u00a0matured, that idea seemed less and less authentic to me. I no longer identified with such a narrow view of sexuality, but the problem was that I needed my emotions to catch up with my ideas. Somehow what I thought was okay and normal for everybody else seemed wrong and somehow immoral when it applied to me. I had a late start in the dating world, and because of my lack of sexual experience, I was usually dealing with a lot of anxiety around the \"virginity\" issue. \u00a0When I decided to share that piece of information about myself with some of my dates, that was often the last conversation we would have. Those types of reactions led me to consider \"just getting it over with\" but I knew that wouldn't be a good decision for me to make. <strong></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Any thoughts on how our culture views virginity?<br />\n</strong><br />\n<br />\nI hate the word \"virgin.\" Ugh. And don't get me started on the whole \"white dress and veil\" thing either ;-) I don't know why so many people (and media outlets) think it is their business to pass judgment on other people's sexual activity. \u00a0Even though I was happy with my decision to remain a \"virgin,\" I had so much shame attached to that label because of what we are all bombarded with constantly from the media: being a virgin is somehow considered laughable and disgraceful. I find that the pressure from the media pushes young people to make decisions and take action with their sexuality that they are just not ready for. Why can't sexuality be seen as the personal journey that it really is? It can be such a wonderful path of self-discovery.<br />\nWhen the time was right for me to take the final step, I just knew. I'm in a loving relationship, my partner did not have an adverse reaction to my \"news,\" and it just seemed silly to wait any longer because I didn't want to. The funny thing is that for all these years, I was building up that final act of penetration to be such a huge deal. Finally, it just meant that I was a little bit physically closer to my partner. All of our previous experiences up until that point were just as intimate, and just as special. I'm happy that I waited as long as I did because it meant that I had what was for me a perfect experience. My only regret is that I spent so many years feeling ashamed and upset and somehow \"not good enough\" or \"not desirable enough\" because of where I was on my personal journey.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Want to tell your story?

I consider oral/vaginal/anal sex to all be \"sex\".<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Why did you decide to stay a virgin?</span><br />\nI grew up in a liberal household and my mom is an Ob/<span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_1\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Gyn</span>, so sexuality was never a taboo subject. I had no desire to remain \"pure\" and no strong desire to wed, so waiting till marriage wouldn't work. But my mom made me paranoid about STD/Is and I knew I would never be promiscuous. Plus, I am kind of picky in regards to my friends and my lovers so I wanted to have sexual activity within the context of a relationship.<br />\n<br />\nI went on oral contraceptives at 17 in preparation for college and my mother sent me away with a huge supply of condoms/Plan B. Since I don't drink (a huge activity in college) and spent my time hanging out in the theater department, so meeting men I was interested in didn't really happen. I went on a few dates, kissed some guys, made great friends but nobody I wanted to be in a relationship with appeared.<br />\n<br />\nAround my 20<span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_2\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">th</span> birthday, I began to feel ashamed about my lack of sexual experience. I began to doubt myself, my attractiveness, my <span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_3\" class=\"blsp-spelling-corrected\">desirability,</span> my <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">normalcy.</span> I even started to question if was heterosexual (I definitely was). It seemed the thing that came so easily to everyone else (sex) was so difficult for me. The only individuals I knew who had never engaged in any type of sexual activity beyond kissing at my age were religiously motivated.<br />\n<br />\nI ended up going 3 years without so much as kissing someone and that made me very depressed. There were nights I would cry myself to sleep just because I longed to be touched, to feel that connection to another human being. The worse thing was feeling as if it would <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">never</span> change, and I would <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">never</span> have the experiences I longed for. I no longer felt my lack of sexual experience was a choice \u2013 it felt more like a punishment. However, I was determined not to have a roll in the hay with the first guy who looked my way.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How did you lose your virginity?</span><br />\nI had vaginal and oral sex, touched a penis and laid in bed with a naked man for the first time on my 23rd birthday from approximately midnight to 6am! It was the happiest day of my life, and all of the things I thought I would be \u2013 scared, nervous, ashamed \u2013 I wasn't any of those things. I was just happy.<br />\n<br />\nI had moved back to my home city the year before to go to law school, and 7 months before my birthday I met a guy who lived in my building. I was attracted to him instantly and for the first time I felt as if someone wanted me as much as I wanted them. It was sweet and pleasurable and intimate and completely worth staying up till 6am for! However, we broke up a few months later due to things entirely not related to sex. I don't regret our experience together for one second.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">I never told him I had never had sex because:</span><br />\n1.When my friend R., who believed oral sex wasn't sex, finally decided she wanted to have vaginal intercourse, she was rejected four times. I was afraid the same thing would happen to me: guys would learn I had never had vaginal intercourse and back out during the heat of foreplay. I didn't want to risk that \u2013 or risk that he would find it <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_4\" class=\"blsp-spelling-corrected\">attractive</span></span> that I was \"untouched.\" Both were equally distasteful.<br />\n<br />\n2. I didn't think it was any of his business! My sexual life before him was private, and once we both got tested before we had sex, I had no desire to learn about his previous sexual experiences. Having penetrated myself with sex toys for the last few years I knew there was no need to worry about pain or discomfort.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">My thoughts on virginity</span>:<br />\nThe emotional baggage that went along with feeling unwanted and undesirable and \"different/defective\" was much more damaging than the physical act of never having had sex. If I want t0 have an orgasm I can through masturbation. While the physical gratification can't be overlooked, how I feel mentally about my sexuality is much more important than what body part has touched another body part. I am happy that my first time was everything I wanted it to be. Maybe because I spent years and years waiting for it, the universe threw me a bone!<br />\n<br />\nI'm not going to be less picky about who I choose to be with just because I am no longer a virgin. I believe our culture places too much emphasis on the first time one has sex (especially for women) as if the first time is the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">only</span> time that is special, the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">only</span> time one should consider if sex is the right choice for you. If everyone was as particular about the 50<span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_5\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">th</span> they had sex as they were about the first, I think many of the negative consequences of sex (emotional and physical) would be minimized.", "tags": [78, 77, 73, 21, 39, 26, 17, 62, 76, 7, 5, 55, 58, 2, 1], "maxage": 24, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2009/09/first-person-natalie-im-not-going-to-be-less-picky-just-because-i-am-no-longer-a-virgin/", "date": "2009-09-29", "definition": "oral/vaginal/anal sex is all \u201csex\u201d", "aboutyou": "My name is Natalie, and I'm a 24-year-old heterosexual female from the USA, and I'm a law student.

Over the years, I\u2019<span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_1\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">ve</span> had a lot of interesting conversations about my reasons for staying sexless. While I\u2019m not surprised when people disagree with or even insult my choices, there\u2019s one response that\u2019s surprised me: wistfulness.</span></span><br />\n<br />\nA woman will realize I\u2019m still a virgin and the next thing I know, she\u2019s congratulating me and musing about her own love life, especially its disappointments. The bad sex. The frequent bad sex. The great sex with men who <span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_2\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">didn</span>\u2019t stick around. And those are just the stories they\u2019<span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_3\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">ve</span> shared with me. When I hear things like that, it lessens my sense of \"loss\" about spending a decade without sex (I\u2019m 31).<br />\n<br />\nWe tend to think of abstention as missing out, but in reality, what my chastity has denied me is not 10 years of fabulous sex, but an even deeper pain on each occasion when some guy I liked or dated walked away from me. As Alain <span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_4\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">de</span> <span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_5\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Botton</span> said in his novel The Romantic Movement, \"A more melancholy way of looking at the history of sexual technique was to read it as a history of disappointment.\"<br />\n<br />\nNo matter how good or bad sex with each man in my past could have been, whatever might have been would not have lasted. Thanks to the clarity of history, I now know that each time I met someone and thought we had great potential, my imagination far surpassed the reality. Even if I had had sex with those men, I still would not have married them \u2014 and that for me is the real goal.<br />\n<br />\nI don\u2019t want a boyfriend who, as a pithy coffee <span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_6\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">barista</span> here in San Francisco once put it, would discard me like a shoe or car when he tires of me. I want someone with whom I can build a life. And if it takes only one person to make that happen, why should I need lots of lovers in the meantime?<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Experience!</span> You might be shouting. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Practice! Finding out if you are compatible in bed, for God\u2019s sake!</span><br />\n<br />\nBut the thing is, all this talk of compatibility translates to, Does he do what I like? Does he meet MY needs? And however common a mindset that might be, it\u2019s fundamentally selfish. This sounds innocent and harmless when we\u2019re talking about our own behavior, but it <span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_7\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">doesn</span>\u2019t take long to realize that we don\u2019t wish others behaved more selfishly toward us. Sex, of course, is difficult. In fact, I suspect it might be one of the hardest human exchanges in which to try to putting another\u2019s needs before your own. I doubt it can be done without extensive practice at unselfishness and denying self-centered impulses in other, easier settings. But since that\u2019s a challenge I face every day when I board a crowded train or use the communal kitchen at the office, I can actually work on becoming the sort of person who\u2019ll be a good lover without getting anywhere near a bed. And by the same measure, I can tell a lot about how selfish or self-giving someone is without ever spending the night with him.<br />\n<br />\nAt this point, some have objected that denying a boyfriend sex could in fact be selfish. But with said hypothetical boyfriend, it\u2019s unlikely we would have yet reached the point of pooling all our resources, forging legal ties and so on. That means, there\u2019d be parts of our lives where we\u2019d still be holding onto things, refusing to share or to trust. Holding nothing and sharing everything in a physical sense, then, would mean taking greater risks with my body than I was willing to do with my finances or my future. And that\u2019s not being unselfish, it\u2019s being unwise and unhealthy.<br />\n<br />\nThis, in the end, is why I\u2019<span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_8\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">ve</span> become the most grateful for my chastity, freakish or not. It might sometimes earn scorn, derision and rejection, but it\u2019s taught me the importance of being whole as a woman. I\u2019d far rather have that than a fragmented pleasure.<span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #660000;\"><br />\n</span>", "tags": [57, 28, 27, 13, 62, 51, 11, 79, 25, 5, 56, 3, 1, 54], "maxage": 31, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2009/10/first-person-annai-knew-what-my-sexual-choice-branded-me-a-freak/", "date": "2009-10-12", "definition": "", "aboutyou": ""}}, {"pk": 20, "model": "firstperson.story", "fields": {"firstgraf": "This week's First Person interview comes from 49-year-old Mark, who talks to us about pagan Greek female mathematicians, cryonics, and why skydiving is like sex.

I grew up in a state on the periphery of the American South. I own way too many books. I work in the hospitality industry in a Southwestern state. I live with a cat named after a pagan Greek female mathematician who was murdered by Christians, though I can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s my cat or if I\u2019m her human.</span><br />\n<br />\nI\u2019m also well known in a couple of fringe tech subcultures called cryonics and <span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_0\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">transhumanism</span>, but not for anything notable I\u2019<span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_1\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">ve</span> accomplished; just for hanging around for a number of years, expressing partly-baked opinions online and coming up with a neologism on one occasion which has apparently \"gone viral,\" as they say.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">What's your definition of virginity?</span><br />\nIn my case, I consider myself a virgin because I\u2019<span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_2\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">ve</span> never ejaculated inside a woman\u2019s vagina, either with or without a condom. That <span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_3\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">doesn</span>\u2019t mean I haven\u2019t had other kinds of physical contact with women, however. (More on that below.)<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Why have you decided to remain a virgin?</span><br />\nI haven\u2019t \"decided\" anything of the sort. One, virginity is the default state, just like not having ever gone skydiving is the default state. Okay, that\u2019s not the best analogy; but you <span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_4\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">wouldn</span>\u2019t find it odd to meet a man my age who had never jumped out of a plane wearing a parachute. You need the opportunity first, before you can exert yourself to lose both your sexual virginity and your skydiving virginity. That is hard to do if you don\u2019t have either a cooperative woman or the plane and a parachute available.<br />\n<br />\nTwo, women serve as the gatekeepers. They have to consent to sexual contact. My sexual desires don\u2019t give me a right or an entitlement to the use of any woman\u2019s body, especially in such an intimate and emotionally complicated way. In other words, women have decided for me that I remain a virgin.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How have your partners reacted?</span><br />\nI\u2019<span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_5\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">ve</span> had a few dates in my life which <span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_6\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">didn</span>\u2019t lead to anything. I suppose I\u2019<span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_7\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">ve</span> had only one attempt at a \"partner,\" whom I met in 1994 (when I was 34) through the tech subcultures I mentioned above. She advertised for men interested in cryonics and possibly marriage in a real paper<br />\nnewsletter that was still published and delivered by mail back then. I contacted her because she seemed a better candidate than any woman I had ever heard of as a plausible girlfriend, and during our long-distance courtship I mentioned my virginity, which intrigued her, I suppose. She agreed to fly out to visit me for sexual relations, which <span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_8\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">didn</span>\u2019t go well at all because I <span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_9\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">couldn</span>\u2019t get an erection to save my life despite our best efforts. I <span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_10\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">didn</span>\u2019t, and don\u2019t, have anything medically wrong with me in that area; it\u2019s just that I lacked the conditioned responses to try to start an adult sex life without practice or preparation at age 34.<br />\n<br />\nFrom hindsight I consider this experience a \"freak accident,\" because if I had met this woman in more socially common way, she probably <span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_11\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">wouldn</span>\u2019t have sexually offered herself to me. A few years later I visited a psychotherapist and told him about my virginity and my sexual dysfunction with this woman. He tried to sell me on a course of treatment with a surrogate and I declined, not only for financial reasons and the distance I\u2019d have to travel; but also because I find the thought of having a strange woman touch me, even in a \"professional\" capacity, distasteful.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Any general thoughts on virginity?</span><br />\nI conjecture that boys growing up into men have a developmental window from their mid teens through their early 20\u2019s to have their first sexual experiences. If they miss that window, they might have problems trying to initiate their adult sex lives later on.<br />\n<br />\nFor example, the sex therapist I mentioned above told me that a lot of his clients are ultra-orthodox Jewish men who don\u2019t start having sex until they get married well into their 20\u2019s, and then discover that their penises don\u2019t want to cooperate. I have to wonder if adult male virgins in other abstinence-obsessed cultures like radical Islam or fundamentalist Christianity also encounter similar problems if they have to wait too long before they gain their community\u2019s approved access to sex in marriage. <span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #660000;\"><br />\n</span>", "tags": [37, 21, 38, 32, 18, 26, 9, 6, 25, 24, 3, 23, 2, 1], "maxage": 49, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2009/10/first-person-markfrom-hindsight-i-consider-the-experience-a-freak-accident/", "date": "2009-11-19", "definition": "never ejaculating inside a woman\u2019s vagina", "aboutyou": "I\u2019m 49 years old, white, male, atheist.

I learned about it in school at primary school and at \"high school\" (we have a different word for that). In primary school, sex education was more like \"When Mum and Daddy love each other \u2026\" and so on, how to make a baby, what happened during pregnancy etc. Then in high school we talked about how our bodies change, what menstruation is, what kind of prevention exist and so on.</span></span><br />\n<br />\nThe word \"pubic area\" in the German language is <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"Schamhaare.\"</span> If you translate it directly, it means \"shame area.\" I had a really cool biology teacher in high school who always said: \"I do not like it to call it \"shame area\" because there is nothing to be ashamed about.\" He gave us a positive feeling about ourselves and our bodies.<br />\n<br />\nWhen I was younger \u2013 13/14 years old \u2013 I started to read the <a href=\"http://www.bravo.de/online/render.php?render=000050\">BRAVO magazine</a>. In Germany it plays a big role in sex education. For many years now, you can write a letter to the Dr. Sommer team and ask everything about sex, relationship and other problems.<br />\n<span><span><span><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Some science:</span></span></span><br />\nA study of the German Federal Center for Health Education showed that 7% of girls 14-years-old and under have already had sexual intercourse. It was 15% of girls by the age of 15, and 30% by the age of 16 years.</span><br />\n<br />\nAt the age of 17 years, 65% of the girls and 59% of boys had had sex. Of that group, 75% of the boys said their first time was good, but only 59% of the girls did.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Tell us about your first time:</span><br />\nI belong to this 30% group: I \"lost\" my virginity when I was 16 years old. I was really in love with this guy, but it was just a short summer relationship, but not even a relationship. He did not want to have a serious relationship because he moved to another town at the end of the summer. He really broke my heart but nevertheless I never regret that I had sex with him. I just felt that this was the right moment and the right guy.<br />\n<br />\nIt was painful and maybe the worst sex I ever had but I did not expected too much from my first time. For me, it was just important that it was the right guy. I really enjoy having sex and for me sex is not always connected with love. It is enough \"just\" to like the person. Of course, it is nice to have sex with the person you love, but that is not necessary.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How do you define virginity?</span><br />\nIt is hard to define virginity because this so-called virginal membrane does not really exist. I think sex is more than penetration because this definition discriminates against lesbians. So I think it is the best is to define this for yourself or even better: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">You do not have to care about it.</span><br />\n<br />\nThis whole virginity thing is based on an old-fashioned moral: The girl has to keep something very \"valuable\", her hymen, otherwise she is a \"slut.\" But the boy is cool when he has sex (he has no piece of skin to lose when he has sex).<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How do German teenagers' attitudes towards sex differ from the US?</span><br />\nWe do not have this \"virginity cult.\" Actually, I suppose for most of the teenagers it is more important to lose their virginity than to keep it. I know only one person who is waiting to have sex until she marries \u2013 and this is more because she is scared of having sex than because of religious reasons.<br />\n<br />\nMost of the people around me do not believe in God, and if they do so, it does not keep them from having sex. Of seven of my closest friends, four of them already had sex, mostly at the age of 16/17, and all of them prevent with the anti-baby-pill. I mentioned one of them wants to stay \"clean\" until marriage, and two of them just have not f0und the right guy yet.<br />\n<br />\n<span><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #660000;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #660000;\">If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href=\"http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/\">submission form</a></strong>.

I struggled my first few years in college trying to learn how the world and people worked. By the time things started crystallizing, I didn't see marriage and myself as a good match.

A more technical definition would be mutual masturbation, oral sex, penetration would all disqualify my definition of virginity. I consider virginity a gift given though, so if one is raped they are still a virgin in my book.</blockquote><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Why have you decided to stay a virgin?</span><br />\nA combination of two elements: the freedom of being alone, and my upbringing. For me having sex is only permitted within marriage. So this is more a question of why I have decided to not get married. I'm not sure where to draw the lines between selfishness, not having a lot in common with others, and wanting to give this freedom to God.<br />\n<br />\nI prefer to spend time alone in my own activities than anything that relates to others. Sometimes even to extent of being in conversations and wishing a Cessna or something would crash through the ceiling to make \"this\" conversation end. I also don't have a lot in common with others beyond the weather, death, and taxes.<br />\n<br />\nThe flip side is that in my beliefs and experience, nothing I do in life has any significance unless it fits somehow into the eternal order of things. Being unmarried means I am not distracted by the cares of this world and supporting a family. I can spend this time exploring the world with God. I can ask how the patterns I am interested in are woven together. I then work on art, music, or computer programs that implement such designs.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How have your dates/partners reacted?</span><br />\nI don't date or have partners. I find it hard to know sometimes when it is best to disclose this information.<br />\n<br />\nFor example, last week a <span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_1\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Facebook</span> contact mentioned that she had trouble trusting people and in particular getting close to men. I thought that since she felt comfortable divulging this to me, never having been in a relationship or even kissing would be a strong indicator of a Very Low Probability for attributing such worries to me. It's been over a week and she hasn't responded. For all I know she has Uncle Ed hiding in her hedges with a shot gun scanning the night for virgin stalkers. So that bombed.<br />\n<br />\nAlso I have family members and coworkers who are fairly convinced that I am homosexual. I am 33, have good health, a college degree in computer science, like artistic things, get bored-to-death watching sports on TV, so this equates to being homosexual for them.<br />\n<br />\nA few of the people I am close to seem to understand. I know of two other virgins; a 27 year old male, and a 30 year old female. Sometimes an unfortunate woman will find out and start circling in on me.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Any thoughts about cultural attitudes towards <span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_2\" class=\"blsp-spelling-corrected\">virginity</span>?</span><br />\nI wish virginity were more of a category within the social mind.

From a pretty young I age I was extremely interested in depictions of sex, and I started masturbating pretty early.<br />\n<br />\nI lost my virginity at the age of fifteen, to a friend, at a party. This obviously makes me a slut to many people. I don't care. I wanted to; I knew him, I trusted him, I really wanted to do it, of course we protected ourselves-I may be a slut but I'm far from stupid, and I remember it as being fun. Not many people I know enjoyed their first time as much as I did, yet I'm the one who's supposed to be regretting it, because I didn't wait for love, or whatnot. Just as well, because I didn't fall in love until I was seventeen, and looking back on it, it was puppy love, and rather hilariously ridiculous.<br />\n<br />\nI have a ridiculously high libido, which does make life complicated at times, because women, as a general rule, aren't supposed to. I've met a few men who felt emasculated by it; those didn't last long.<br />\n<br />\nAll this doesn't mean I'm not picky, as people have implied in conversations where the word \"easy\" has come up. Maybe I am easy, I don't know. Does it matter? I enjoy myself, I don't hurt anyone, my experience is split pretty evenly between casual sex and relationships, and the casual sex didn't leave me a used, empty shell as I've seen in some articles. Preposterous.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Any thoughts about cultural attitudes towards virginity?</span><br />\n<span>I think we all have our own relationship with our sexuality, and I personally do not care whether you'd rather stay a virgin or have sex with five people in the same week. As long as it's safe sex, it's not my place to judge, and it's none of my business. I would just like the same principle be applied to me.</span><br />\n<br />\nI don't like having to defend my choices; I don't see where they're wrong, bad, immoral, or whatnot. I don't see why virgins should have to defend their choices either; if you don't want to have sex, for any reason whatsoever, please don't. I'm a firm believer in doing what's right for you, and that rarely coincides exactly with what society requires or expects of you.<br />\n<br />\nMy experience probably doesn't fit with a lot of your readers, since I'm European first and foremost, but where I'm from it's a lot harder to be an older virgin than to be the school slut. I think shaming anyone over the sexual history/ sexuality is ridiculous, and plain mean.<br />\nI am not defined by my sexuality. It is a part of me, nothing more, nothing less. I have no more, no less value as a non-virgin than I did as a virgin.<br />\n<br />\nIt's funny, because when I first met one of my closest friends here in Taiwan, an American girl, she was still a virgin at the age of twenty-two, and she was embarrassed about it. She only told me once we'd become close friends, and apparently was still worried that I'd judge her for it.

It\u2019s probably a combination of growing up in a traditional society, combined with the fact that I\u2019m a late bloomer.<br />\n<br />\nWhile my religious upbringing was relatively liberal when it comes to observant Judaism, premarital sex has always been taboo; my parents, who are relatively liberal in many other respects, will still occasionally say things like having premarital sex is morally wrong, or will doom your relationship to failure\u2014after all, why would a guy consider marrying you if you\u2019re having sex with him anyway? I don\u2019t agree with them, but that attitude still has an effect.<br />\n<br />\nThe result is that on the one hand, I\u2019m a huge feminist and a staunch believer that women should be free to express themselves sexually, but on the other I have this fear that if I have premarital sex I\u2019ll \"lose value.\" There\u2019s also so much silence surrounding sexuality in my religious community. I know so many traditional but modern Jews who are having sex, but no one will talk about it, and everyone pretends it isn\u2019t happening. So there\u2019s a lot of confusion and stigma.<br />\n<br />\nGrowing up I had crushes on literary characters and movie stars, but it never occurred to me that the men in real life could be sexually interesting until the middle of college.

I start to feel like I\u2019ve led the guy on, and that I can\u2019t make the first move, because if I make a move he\u2019s going to expect to have sex with me, and expects that I\u2019ve already had sex.

I think the main reason for this is because I've never had a serious, long-term relationship in my adult life. I've gone on dates, I've \"messed around,\" had drunken makeouts, but nothing has led to a relationship where I feel comfortable going further sexually. The guys I meet are really only interested in sex and if I don't give that to them within the first few dates or within a month, I'm tossed to the side without so much as a phone call or even a text.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How do you define virginity?</span><br />\n<br />\nI had defined it as vaginal intercourse for a long time, but have recently revised that. I had my first real sexual experience with another person when I was 19, so if it's a matter of a hymen breaking, that was years ago. If it's oral sex, then I was 21. I mean, I've literally been completely naked with another guy, practically going through the motions without insertion and yet by traditional definition, I'm still a virgin.<br />\n<br />\nI feel like not having vaginal intercourse is really a mere technicality, although my close girl friends tend to disagree and still think that I'm a virgin. As much as I love my friends, it's annoying and it kinda hurts when they think everything I've done isn't enough to declassify me as a virgin and that I just need to \"get laid already.\"<br />\n<br />\nI enjoy intimacy immensely, even if it's just a drunk make-out with a friend. As of right now, it's been six months since my last go-round and I think this is the longest dry spell I've had in a couple of years. It's also frustrating being the only single girl when almost all of my friends are either married, engaged or just in a long-term relationship.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How have your partners reacted?</span><br />\n<br />\nMentioning that to the guys I've been intimate with has been a deterrent, although not one has ever said anything derogatory about it. It's almost like they put me on a higher plane because of being my being a virgin in my mid-twenties, and they didn't want to be the \"first one\" to mess it up for me.<br />\n<br />\nOne guy I dated wanted so badly to have sex with me, but once I mentioned the virginity thing, he thought it over, said he absolutely respected my choice. He dumped me 2 1/2 weeks later, saying that we were just \"no mas.\"<br />\n<br />\nI want it to be with someone that I trust, and hopefully, a relationship that will actually go somewhere (not marriage! not ready for that) instead of abruptly ending after a month because I didn't put out fast enough. Maybe it's the guys I meet, they still think it's college and they should \"hook up with as many girls as possible\" and the only relationships worth having are those without strings attached.<br />\n<br />\nI'm TIRED of being the single friend and the third wheel. It always amazes me the girls who jump from one relationship to another like it's nothing. I'm super laid back, smart, educated, I don't have any weird emotional baggage.

I grew up in a less rectangular state, and was pretty standard Christian conservative until I was about 15, with a brief moment of religiosity when I was 22. I'm currently an agnostic, leaning towards atheism, pending further research.<br />\n<br />\nMy parents do not discuss sex. I was home-schooled when most kids were taking sex ed in my district, so I read a book about how sex worked, shortly followed by a book on how I should \"court\" guys with the approval of my father. Luckily for my sister and me, our dad never really enforced courtship.<br />\n<br />\nBeing bi, sexual attraction was super complicated, especially in a religious household. I sort of kept all of my attractions under wraps until I hit college which means I didn't mention it or try to think about it. I hit the end of my freshman year by going to England as part of a class and making out with multiple nameless guys. And then there was the years long dry spell of no make outs, no boyfriends, no girlfriends, while I worked on school, and then grad school. That sort of brings us to today.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">What is your definition of virginity?</span><br />\nBecause of my orientation, I think defining sex is the first step. I know a lot of folk are more strict about the definition of sex. For me the definition of sex is two or more people who are making an effort to get each other to orgasm in a consensual situation, and generally nudity is involved. It's maddeningly vague.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Why did you decide to stay a virgin?</span><br />\nI signed a virginity pledge (hilariously misspelled) when I was about 13 as a precaution should I start feeling immoral thoughts about boys, because liking girls was just \"weird\" and not possible. All my friends sort of kept up with the whole, \"I will remain a virgin\" until marriage at least in theory. When I went to college, I met a group of awesome sex-positive women of all orientations, who, incidentally, all lived on my floor. While I am not in contact with many of them anymore, they were integral in my acknowledgment that I was more than a little bit gay when I was 21.<br />\n<br />\nAs to why I decided to stay a virgin: In short, I'm really goal oriented. In my head I had a list of priorities in my life. The priority list was as follows:<br />\n1. School. (High school, getting into college, College, Getting into grad school, Grad school)<br />\n2. Work<br />\n3. Friends<br />\n4. ???<br />\n5. Sex<br />\nSo, I went through life checking off my priorities, and sex was just something that kept being put off because I was busy doing other things.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How did you 'lose your virginity?'</span><br />\n\"Lost\" really isn't the right word. I chucked it with great force at the first actual opportunity I had at the ripe old age of 26. Granted, I don't recommend my methods to everyone, because the part of me that likes to be safe will point out that this was a bit of a risk. Flying to a completely different state to meet up with someone you'd never actually met is risky, no matter what. That being said, I had fun, it turned out well, and no one was an axe murderer (always a bonus).<br />\n<br />\nI'm very shy and have a bit of social anxiety, so I tend to communicate with my friends on the internet and have made a few friends that way. One of these internet friends (Let's call him A) who I'd been talking to for quite awhile invited me to visit him and a polyamorous partner of his (female, and I'll call her B) in another state. After much hemming and hawing, I agreed, although to this day I'm not entirely sure why or how I decided to go.<br />\n<br />\nPrior to even making the official trip plans, I had divulged my virginal status to A. I'm not really sure why, considering how much shame I felt about it at the time, but it saved me a very awkward in person conversation, which I'd have probably stuttered through or not had.<br />\n<br />\nI ended up on a plane to this other state for a long weekend where I met A and B at the airport. We hung out that evening, went to museum, had dinner, and went to bed together, where nudity ensued, with yes, two people I had met that day. And thus I lost my gay virginity. It took a couple of days before I had actual penis-in-vagina sex, between false starts and me having a minor panic attack (thanks social anxiety and related to meeting lots of new people all at once) my first full day. I'll be honest, there was awkwardness on my part and occasional pain, but both were pretty temporary.<br />\n<br />\nOverall, the weekend was very fun and I can't think of a better way to do it. My partners in deflowerment really couldn't have been nicer.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Any thoughts about cultural attitudes towards virginity?</span><br />\nI feel a certain degree of envy for those who actively choose to remain virgins because in some ways, it's more empowering. There's a choice in the matter. After a while, I felt like I didn't have a choice. It was either be a cat lady or give up swearing, become a Catholic, and join a nunnery. For me, the issue became more and more about how I felt I was unattractive and that while I was willing to have sex, for whatever reason, I was not good enough, which isn't conducive to getting anyone close to your pants.<br />\n<br />\nIt's rough. We're all supposed to wait for that one special person to lose it to. Even if we don't stay with that individual, you're supposed to hold out for someone \"special.\" But if you wait too long, you feel shameful about how long it's taken, because there must be something wrong with you.

I'm currently single, but have had a couple long term relationships. I grew up in farm country and have recently moved to the big city to pursue my career. I don't know if its more the cultural differences or just the fact that I'm older, but my virginity has never been as much a \"topic of conversation\" than it has in the last year that I've been here.<br />\n<br />\nI was raised semi-religious and was taught the Christian rules but we didn't really do the church thing. We got the general \"Sex is what two married people do\" and \"Don't get pregnant, use a condom\" answers. My parents acknowledged that my sisters and I might have sex, but they hoped we wouldn't. Nonetheless, the \"marriage\" part stuck with me and I've yet to hear a good reason to believe it should be any different.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How do you define virginity?</span><br />\nTo each his own I suppose. Its an interesting debate and people who limit it to \"this or that\" are missing the bigger picture. I'd go with genital to genital or to anal, to be 100% not a virgin. But a lot of it is really more an emotional experience. If you feel you're still a virgin, then you're still a virgin. I plan on waiting until I'm married to do anything that would require either of us removing our pants.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Why did you decide to stay a virgin?</span><br />\nI'm not a zealot, but I believe that ones spirituality and relationship with God is what makes us truly human. Maintaining my virginity is my own way of showing that I can be more than my sexual urges. Its same reason I haven't done drugs or smoked cigarettes. \"Because it feels good\" is not an answer that will make me a better person. (I probably shouldn't drink either... :-/ Nobody's perfect.) Not everyone will agree with my religious perspectives, but there are a lot of non-religious reasons as well.<br />\n<br />\nPhysical-ness is an important part of any relationship, but if I can't find a man who loves me for my heart and my head, he's not the kind of man I want having all of my body. For all you avid blog readers out there, my favorite <a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/www.postsecret.com\">postsecret</a> of all time says <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"I fake it with you 50% of the time. But I wouldn't want to fake it with anyone else\" </span>To me, THAT, is love. Sex is a part of it, but just a part.<br />\n<br />\nPlus, sex can complicate things. In my experience even making out can complicate things.<br />\n<br />\nI have nothing against people who have responsible sex before marriage. I've even tossed the idea around myself. But I think too many people use sex as an emotional band-aid and having random, casual sex usually does more harm than good.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How have your dates/partners reacted?</span><br />\nMy first real relationship was over a year long and we never even talked about it, I just always stopped it at some point and he accepted it. My other long term boyfriend agreed that we should wait so that was that. I recently told a man I was interested in that I wanted to wait and I think it turned him off. We're still good friends but when we drink he'll often say things like \"It sucks that this girl I really like wont have sex with me.\" But I figure it's his loss. I don't need anyone who thinks like that.<br />\n<br />\nI'd like to start a relationship, and maybe even fall in love, before the conversation even comes up. A man in love with me would see that I'm worth waiting for (because I believe I am, and I wish more girls would see that they are too) than one who is simply in lust.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Any special plans or ideas for losing it?</span><br />\nOn my wedding night with my husband. And I very much intend for it to be hot, very hot.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Anything else you want to say about virginity?</span><br />\nVirginity is just another label that people are asked to try and fit themselves into. I believe too many young girls think they become woman when they have sex and that it's the grown up thing to do. I think in the back of his or her mind is always the thought that \"well this is what I'm supposed to be doing, cause this is what normal people do.\"<br />\n<br />\nOur society (and our parents) put too much energy into teaching bout sex and not enough emphasis on love, emotions, and communication. (Don't get me wrong, I'm all for safe sex ed) But we need to talk more about self worth, girls need to know that sex doesn't define them, and that they are worth waiting for, at least beyond the first date, and on their own terms.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, if I'm 40 and still not married, there probably is no God, no love, or good men left. I then intend to become the randiest cougar on the planet.

I write a blog about being a single virgin. I like chocolate.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How do you define virginity?</span><br />\nI was taught during sex education at school is that a virgin is someone who hasn't had penetrative sex, and that is still my personal definition of it. But I have seen discussion that it means <span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_0\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">someone's</span> experience in a sexual act, which makes sense especially for defining lesbian sex.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Why did you decide to stay a virgin?</span><br />\nI was a bit of a late bloomer, my mates were dating and I was off galloping on a horse across the Sussex downs. Admittedly I am not in the Cathrine Zeta-Jones league when it comes to looks. I was very much a wallflower and would sit in a dark corner. Once I got to university I found out how sexual I was. Like any woman, I was still very critical about my looks but became less of a wall flower.<br />\n<br />\nI have had partners (well more like tragic dates) and they never went well. My very first was with a semi-stalker who demanded to know where I was 24hrs a day. The next couple were very insecure and more like children then men, wanting their hand held and wanting someone to wait outside the loos for them.<br />\n<br />\nI did meet a couple of nice men while out drinking with some university mates, but one freaked me out by asking me to be in a \"film.\" Also had my fair share of make-out sessions at the back of the club. It seems I am doomed to get stuck with the bottom-of-the-barrel men.<br />\n<br />\nThe one guy I could see myself being with didn't tell me his feelings and returned to Wales after finishing our course. I heard it through one of his mates and by then it was too late.<br />\n<br />\nI have thought about just going out and doing it, but I have friends that lost their virginity at a young age to strangers and their stories of pain were a bit off-putting. I know each person is different but I don't want to be thinking about it while in the act.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How have your partners reacted?</span><br />\nSadly none stuck around long enough to tell. Most of my friends have been supportive.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Any general thoughts on virginity in our society?</span><br />\nIn film and TV they mock a person who is a virgin over a certain age, which as a virgin watching is uncomfortable. In magazines we are bombarded by <span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_1\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">photoshopped</span> super slender women and muscle-bound men and expected to look like that and be very sexually active.<br />\n<br />\nA few years ago I told some people in confidence that I was a virgin and they used it in a fight to shame me and a guy I was flirting with.

We'd love to run it in this blog!<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Tell us about yourself:</span><br />\nI am a 26 year old, white, male, heterosexual, college graduate, who is middle class and a virgin. I would say, for the most part, I am a fairly normal, well adjusted individual.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How do you define virginity?</span><br />\nI used to believe that it applied to penetrative sex, unless the kind of sexual act was specified. However, after visiting this site, I see that that definition leaves out people of different sexual orientations. It just depends on the person and the act.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Why did you decide to stay a virgin?</span><br />\nThrough high school, it was not really a decision. I was not popular and was rather hefty, so I did not date. My mother would have preferred if I had stayed a virgin, and my father didn't really care. While I grew up in a religious household, it didn't feel like virginity was paramount. When I got to college, I dated a girl for the first time, and she was deeply religious. This impacted my view on virginity, and I decided I wanted to stay chaste until marriage.<br />\n<br />\nAfter that relationship, I dated another girl for a year and a half. We fooled around, but, pardoning the metaphor, never went past second base. This changed after a year, and we moved to oral sex. I had been hesitant to do so, mostly because, due to my wish to wait to have sex, I didn't want to go too far too quick. Near the end of our relationship, she wanted to have penetrative sex. She said that she wanted a commitment.<br />\n<br />\nWe were both too young for marriage (she was 20, I was 23), and I think, due to my beliefs, she felt that us having sex would be a good commitment. I was very against this. I was uncomfortable with why she wanted to do it, using sex as a surrogate of sorts for a proposal. I also think it was a way for her to attempt to fix the relationship, which was starting to fail at this point.<br />\n<br />\nI realized after a few failed relationships that marriage was kind of an arbitrary deadline. At the end of the day, I realized that my choice to stay a virgin had nothing to do with my religious beliefs, and far more to do with my self esteem. I feel that if I were to lose my virginity to someone and then the relationship end, it would eat at me. I don't think I would be able to handle the rejection after sharing such an intimate, momentous experience in my life.<br />\n<br />\nAs far as virginity goes, you only have one shot. I want it to be with someone with whom that act will build something. I want it to have emotional meaning, not just a chore to be completed in order to be considered an adult. When I lose my virginity, I want it to be with someone who I love, and I want it to be a good, positive experience for the both of us. It really doesn't matter if she is a virgin. It doesn't matter if we are married. It just matters if it is the right time, it is the right person, and that it is part of a lifetime partnership.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How have your partners reacted?</span><br />\nWhen I tell a partner that I am a virgin, it is generally met with surprise. Because of how I look (I've lost a lot of weight since college), I think people just assume I'm sexually active. My partners have, for the most part, respected the choice, and it has not been an issue.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Any general thoughts on virginity in our society?</span><br />\nI feel often times in our society, virgins are treated as naive, inexperienced, and religious zealots. It is as if we can't truly know what love is, or what sexual pleasure is like. Most of my good friends know about my virginity, and though it is poked fun at, it is in a positive way. But often, a virgin's opinions can be dismissed in conversations about sex because of their perceived inexperience.<br />\n<br />\nI know that there are a lot of virgins that are ashamed of that aspect of themselves, and I think it's due to the label that our society places on us, and the stereotypes that are held. To quote an earlier poster, my virginity does not define me. It is an aspect of my overall self.<br />\n<br />\nBut, to a large degree, I feel empowered by my virginity. I have the power to say no to sex. I've heard some people regret losing their virginity, due to the circumstances of one sort or another (too young, wrong person, etc). But I have the ability to decide when, with who, and what the other circumstances are. I can make it exactly what I want it to be, and that is powerful.", "tags": [92, 27, 28, 13, 51, 10, 35, 31, 6, 25, 7, 24, 56, 58, 3, 23, 1], "maxage": 26, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2010/04/first-person-willi-feel-empowered-by-my-virginity-i-have-the-power-to-say-no-to-sex/", "date": "2010-04-20", "definition": "depends on the person and the act.", "aboutyou": "I am a 26 year old, white, male, heterosexual, college graduate, who is middle class and a virgin.

My theory on life is that it improves in your 30s (more money, more mature, and better at sex). But I'm glad I did it, because hey, why not.

Now, I find that definition unsatisfactory for lots of reasons. It is not just that this definition applies only to heterosexuals, but I'm not sure that it works for heterosexuals either.\u00a0When we talk about virginity loss we are not simply talking about a physical change, but something far more complex, an intangible, filled with deeply symbolic meanings. The categories of \"virgin\" and \"non-virgin\" fail to take into account the richness of sexual experience. It invests so much in one single moment (the moment in which a penis first enters a vagina) as this moment of profound change in our lives\u2013when we pass magically from girls into women.<br />\nWe are taught that this moment will somehow determine the rest of our sexual lives and it's a decision we take cautiously, because (as women especially) we are told that when and how we lose our virginity has a lot to say about the people we are.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Why did you wait and why did you stop waiting?</strong><br />\nAs a girl, I grew up hearing that for women sex is profoundly emotional. We must be careful, we must protect ourselves, and we must be very, very certain that the decisions we make about sex are the right ones. Why? Because the emotions that accompany sex for women might be too difficult or overwhelming if not shared with the right person at the right time.<br />\nWhen I did finally have sex it was with a guy, a friend of a friend, who I knew for about twelve hours.\u00a0 They were a significant twelve hours in my life, and they were not devoid of emotion; in fact, they were full of emotion\u2013excitement, aliveness, and loneliness too\u2013but I did not fall in love as I knew I would not, nor did I fall apart (as had for years been subconsciously told I could).<br />\nRecently, after hearing I had had sex, the a male friend said of the guy: \"I am not sure this guy was deserving of that.\" An older friend said to me, \"Well, you are still emotionally a virgin.\" My younger sister, outraged at my one-night-stand said: \"Sarah, if a guy is worth it, he shouldn't care about your past.\"<br />\nThese comments, though meant well, have a somewhat disturbing message underpinning them: that my sexuality is somehow not my own.\u00a0 That I threw away my virginity too easily.\u00a0 That somehow the sex I had was meaningless because it was not shared with a partner.\u00a0 That I had sex for my future partners or just to get it over with.\u00a0 When in fact, I had sex because I wanted to.<br />\nI found a deeper truth I had known for a long time but was finally giving power to: Each sexual encounter is an expression of my sexuality, but my sexuality has to do with so much more than who I have sex with, or how much sex I have, or if I have ever had sex before. It has to do with my own relationship to my body.\u00a0 My sexuality is deeply rooted in me.<br />\nI can trust in my own desires, my own emotions and move with them. Experiences don't have to fall on the categories of \"right\" or \"wrong\" or \"mistake\".\u00a0 They are simply expressions of myself\u2013among\u00a0 many I will make over the course of my life\u2013some of which will feel more authentic than others but all of which matter and are important and true.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Any thoughts on virginity in our society?\u2028\u2028</span><br />\nPerhaps the most lasting message girls get is that sex is powerful, scary, and has the potential to hurt you if you are not ready for it.\u00a0 I think back to my brother and the messages he he received. Decide when you are ready and be safe. Boys hear, in essence, that they are able to make their own choices; that they should trust in their own intelligence and are aware enough of their desires to make responsible decisions about sex.\u00a0 What a girl hears is very different: That her emotions and desires are not to be trusted but that she should be protected from them.\u00a0 That she is fragile and could make a bad decision that will leave her harmed.<br />\nIt perpetuates this notion that our sexuality is defined by external factors.\u00a0I think of sexuality differently; as something internal whose movement outward takes many forms of expression and sex itself is only one of those.\u00a0 In this I find great freedom and confidence and joy.", "tags": [84, 69, 73, 72, 11, 34, 95, 62, 16, 5, 58, 3, 2, 1, 80, 46], "maxage": 25, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2010/11/first-person-sarah-sexual-experiences-dont-have-to-fall-into-the-categories-of-right-or-wrong-or-mistake-they-are-simply-expressions-of-myself/", "date": "2010-11-16", "definition": "it fails to take into account the richness of sexual experience, It invests too much in one single moment, when we pass magically from girls into women", "aboutyou": "I am 25 years old and studying creative writing in New York City.\u00a0 I grew up in Texas, and until a few months ago, I was a virgin."}}, {"pk": 45, "model": "firstperson.story", "fields": {"firstgraf": "This week's\u00a0First Person interview comes from 19-year-old Josey, who has talks about how being a victim of sexual abuse has affected her relationships today.

A dildo in the case of lesbians. Being \"pure\" seems completely different. If you do oral and whatnot you are no longer \"pure.\" But I won't go into details with that.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Why have you chosen to remain a virgin?</strong><br />\n<br />\nFirst of all I have to say I have never been on a date. I assumed I was asexual until I met someone very special last year. He was in my Psychology class and we clicked right away. I was starting to get close to him right away. This is very rare for me. I thought about him every day. I had to hold back on what I told him because I am a very private person. I could not focus in my earlier class because I wanted to see him. I just loved him so much but I still had to protect myself. He liked me back and tried hanging out but I was vulnerable and I told him to get a girlfriend.<br />\n<br />\nHe did and I was heartbroken. I did not do this for no reason. I was so scared to say I had no experience. The other problem was I was not comfortable with any type of intimacy. I was molested when I was only 8. I told my mom but she looked at me and then went to go watch TV. I could not sleep after this event. I would ask her to help me but she would just hit me. I guess that was the event that that completely destroyed me.<br />\n<br />\nI went to go see the school psychologist for 4 weeks and it helped me a lot. I don't think I will panic in such a way if an event like this happens again. Intimacy will probably be a big problem but I will take it slowly. For now I hope these feelings will not happen again because I feel that I don't want to deal with such a situation again. But if it does I will probably have to see the psychologist again but I'm okay with that. What my mother did will always stick with me.<br />\n<br />\nI can't imagine falling in love like that again. I'm afraid the guy will go too fast and then cheat on me. I also don't want to tell him what happened to me when I was 8. That was also what I was afraid of saying to the guy I fell for last year. I guess I will have to wait it out and focus on my school.<br />\n<br />\nI can't talk about how people have reacted to this because I don't go out and talk about it. People don't assume that because they apparently they think I'm pretty. I also am comfortable with talking about sex.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Anything else you want to say about virginity or our cultural attitudes towards it?</strong><br />\n<br />\nPeople make a big deal over nothing. Movies and TV make sex seem so casual. They make us think if we are over 18 and a virgin there is something wrong with us. That is totally wrong. There is nothing shameful about being a virgin. Even the male ones shouldn't be ashamed. I'm not embarrassed at all. I won't just randomly go out and tell everyone I'm a virgin. Unless it comes up.<br />\n<br />\nFor those who have suffered from sexual abuse I beg that you go to therapy. I have seen a huge change socially in myself. I used to be completely closed off and now I have learned to enjoy life. I will wait it out and see if I fall in love again. I'll have to wait and see. Even If I end up being a virgin at 30 it will be okay.

Its so loaded with stifling negative assumptions. I don't really label myself a virgin in the traditional sense. I mean, yes, the final step in \"losing it\" for me, a 25-year-old black straight-ish cis woman, is vaginal penetration with a penis. But the key word there is \"step.\" To me, throwing off your virginity isn't like smashing a window, but ascending a flight of stairs. Its a series of experiences that lead to that personal point where one feels they've completed sexual debut. And my experiences to date just don't confine me to the traditional virgin/non-virgin binary.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How did you lose your virginity, or why have you kept it?</span><br />\nI'm losing my virginity in slow motion. That's really the best way to describe it. I spent my high school years in the Southern Baptist church (my form of teenage rebellion), which gave me rather twisted and unhealthy notions of sex, love and relationships. At 18, I called myself conservative, signed a purity pledge and even thought I'd save my first kiss for the altar, because that's what \"good girls\" did.<br />\n<br />\nLater, in college, I realized how duped I'd been by the church, and things began to change. Here's the rundown:<br />\n<br />\nMy first kiss was at 19. I was 22 for my first make out session. 23 the first time I was fingered, and got completely naked in front of someone. 24 when I gave my first blow job, got lip service, did insertion and had what I now recognize was a \"just the tip\" experience (thank you, NOLA).<br />\n<br />\nAnd at 25, the first (and only) time I had a partnered orgasm. So far, that's 5 \"virginities.\" No P-in-V yet, but each of those experiences are very important to me and really feel like virginities in and of themselves.<br />\n<br />\nFor a long time, I wasn't ready to go that step. I was still a slave to that Baptist idea that sex irrevocably damages you. It was only recently, after reading \"Yes Means Yes\" and \"The Purity Myth\" that I've finally broken the chains. And that partnered orgasm? It was with a very dear friend and where I finally decided I was ready take that last step (well, that's putting it mildly. I was damn near begging for it). Although we didn't (he was hesitant to hurt our relationship), it was still a profound realization. At last, there's nothing holding me back. And that's when I decided to create my own rules.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Which are?</span><br />\nRule #1: NEVER fake it.

Not that there haven't been girls that I've liked, quite the opposite; but even thinking about telling a girl about how I feel sends me into a full-blown panic attack. I often feel that drugs and booze are the only way that I can express myself, but those sometimes turn against me; I simply don't know what to think.<br />\n<br />\nIt might worth adding a few things: I didn't come from a religious or repressive household; on the contrary, I have always been able to discuss sex and relationship issues openly with my family. I'm not a hopeless romantic either, and although I certainly would like to find a special someone, I'm not naively hung-up on saving it as something major; at this point, I'd rather just get it over with so if and when I do find someone I'm not completely awkward and inept.<br />\n<br />\nLastly, I have no problems talking to girls on a friendly level, and I cherish having female friends who lend balance to the testosterone circus (and though they are female, they will always be my 'dudes'). It's only when I find myself developing more-than-friend feelings that I panic; I'm currently looking into therapy for that.<br />\n<br />\nI discovered [this blog] couple of months ago, and it has since been a source of comfort for me.

My Catholic upbringing regularly impressed notions of chastity, purity, sexual repression, and guilt guilt guilt. I have been socialized with the idea that if you get to 22 and you haven\u2019t had sex yet, there\u2019s something wrong. I was sure being overweight had something to do with it. I was sure my personality had something to do with it. As I got older, I was sure my lack of experience had something to do with it. There\u2019s got to be something wrong with me, or my body, or my way of life.</span><br />\n<br />\nBut here\u2019s the thing: there isn\u2019t.<br />\n<br />\nThe revelation of my not-virginity came to me in pieces. The first was while I was skyping with Becky. We were talking about me being a virgin, despite the fact that I know more about sex than a lot of people. Despite the fact that I am better than most people at talking about sex. Despite the fact that I am extremely familiar with my body, my desires, my needs. The second half of this revelation was a day later while re-reading <a href=\"http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/about-yes-means-yes/\">Yes means Yes!</a>, particularly in an essay by Hanne Blank about \"process-oriented virgins\". I have subscribed to a transitional approach to virginity for a while, but in my brain claiming \"not virgin\" still required experience with some kind of partnered sex. Why is \"virgin\" a label people people can claim despite conventional evidence to the contrary? Why isn\u2019t \"not-virgin\"? And of course, it is.<br />\n<br />\nI still carry with me a lot of the implications virginity has on my life. Sometimes I am sort of terrified by the idea of flirting because it might lead to some kind of relationship (friendship or romantic) and I would feel weirdly obligated to reveal my virginity and they would scoff and leave me alone. Now I can start regularly thinking \"I am not a virgin\", acclimating to the idea, and letting those words sink into my daily actions.<br />\n<br />\nI am not here to stabilize notions of virginity or female sexuality. I am here to claim my body as my own and claim my experience as valid. I have never engaged in partner sex, and I might never choose to do so. I have decided, here and now, not to be burdened by the label of virgin.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">And a note from Allie: </span>This is one of my submissions to the ongoing series \"When did you know?\", an examination of the intersection of labels and identity.

I\u2019ve got a pretty different idea about virginity which has developed over the last few years, where I realised for around 14 years ago that although I was physically no longer a virgin, psychically my virginity was still intact. Despite having 7 lovers, it was only with my dearest soul-mate that I finally lost my virginity, when I learned to make love, instead of having sex.<br />\n<br />\nThe fact stands that I waited till I was 22 before I completed the physical act of penis-in-vagina intercourse. I won\u2019t delude myself, like I did at the time, I had waited for Mr Right. He turned out to be Mr Personality Disorder and I had a miserable 7+ years with him. Sexual intercourse with someone with a personality disorder who is bent on destroying your self-esteem is a good way to develop sexual inhibitions, but I look back now and realise I never fully gave all of myself to him. For all the pleasure I gave (and received, as I do enjoy sex) it was just that \u2013 sex \u2013 not love making.<br />\n<br />\nOnce released, by him running off with his 19-year-old-assistant, I set about finding out what I had missed and I had fun, having sex with a string of men, many of whom I am still in contact with and even friends with today. Some I knew before my divorce, others I met along the way. I had great sex, but never made love with any of them. I held back a part of myself, perhaps more than I did with my ex-husband, because of my emotional scars from that relationship.<br />\n<br />\nThere was one man who was different from the rest \u2013 a professional colleague, someone who was my intellectual equal. Someone whom I had intense conversations with about many things, including spirituality. A married man. We both struggled with the issue of his being married. Becoming lovers was not on either of our agendas, both of us valued fidelity within a marriage relationship. One night, before he was going into a disciplinary hearing at work, and I was resigning from my job, we came together. I started as I had always done with my lovers \u2013 to have sex with this man, yet at the point of seeking his pleasure, I found my own and it suddenly became something new. We were making love. We were both vulnerable and exposed, and in doing this we found a new freedom of expression.<br />\n<br />\nThe happy ending was not possible at this time \u2013 were we to be together, he would lose his daughters in an inequitable family court system which granted custody to the female parent almost without exception. We parted, and agreed no contact was the best approach, him to return to trying to be a husband and a father, me to work out what I wanted from life.<br />\n<br />\nEight years on, our paths cross again. He is divorcing, I am single. Biggest problem; we live in different countries. Both of us assumed that eight years would have changed who we were, how we were.<br />\n<br />\nNo, there was no change, it was like there had been a pause, then a breath of eight years and we were still connected and attuned in a way neither of us had experienced before or since. We now navigate a long-distance relationship and when we are together we make love. I\u2019ve talked to him about my thoughts and feelings on this, and we both share a wicked enough sense of humour that we have been known to say after love making \"Damn, we failed to have sex, that was definitely making love.\"<br />\n<br />\nIf someone had asked me what a virgin was at 20, I would have given a strictly physical definition.

She met a guy online who ended up coming to her town for work. They met up one evening and here's what happened:</span><br />\n<br />\nI had planned on meeting him somewhere public, but eventually went to the hotel where he was staying, even though I wasn't exactly comfortable with the idea <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">[please see our note at the bottom of this post]</span>. So I get to his room, and he is just ridiculously hot. We sat on the bed and started talking. It turned out that we are both of [the same ethnic] heritage, which made him even more attractive to me and vice versa.<br />\n<br />\nWe were making out within 15 minutes and the clothes were mostly off within 30 minutes. We ended up not doing full penetration only because he was kind of big and it hurt like hell when he tried. I never said anything about my previous experience, but he did ask how many guys I'd been with. I panicked a little and said only one, which he found surprising. Pretty much everything we did was stuff I had done before. I really wanted to stay the night, but the thought of doing a walk of shame in front of my parents the next morning didn't seem like a great idea.<br />\n<br />\nI really don't feel like I \"lost\" anything or that I'm suddenly a different person. I guess technically I'm not a virgin anymore, but I feel more like I just went a little bit further with him than I had done with previous partners.<br />\n<br />\nHe was definitely the first guy to bring me to orgasm, so that part was different. I really think had he not been a) so attractive and b) so sexually aggressive (in a good way), it probably would've just been another makeout. I'm more shocked at myself in that I was so intimate with someone I literally know like five things about.<br />\n<br />\nWe talked a little the next day. He asked if that's something I do a lot, and I told him no, what I had done was so out of character for me. I teased him about probably having a girl like me in every city he's laid over in, and he said no. I'm not completely sure if I believe him, but anyway, I don't regret it at all. I talked it over with my best friend, and she congratulated me and thought it was best for me to do it with someone like that so that my heart isn't broken if it was someone I was in a relationship with. I kind of agree and kind of don't.<br />\n<br />\nI'm just surprised I was able to sleep with a guy that was so incredibly good looking and thought the same about me. He knew what he was doing, and listened when I said I didn't like something he was doing or was uncomfortable. It was just fun and crazy.<br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #990000;\">And now an update on the update:</span></strong><br />\n<br />\nI still haven't heard from the hottie in the story since that weekend, but I've met a really nice guy since then and we've been dating the last few weeks.<br />\n<br />\nIt's nice not feeling like I have the \"virgin\" burden weighing on me, but he did say after we were intimate the first time \"You haven't had a lot of sex, have you?\" I said yes, but that I wasn't a virgin and didn't go into much detail after that. He seemed satisfied with that answer.

I grew up in a happy, loving, supportive family in Southern Louisiana. I've never been involved in a romantic relationship. I've been told that it's because I don't \"put myself out there.\" Part of that is a fear of rejection. Another part is that I'm the kind of person who takes a while to warm up to new people, and that gets interpreted as being shy and reserved.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong><br />\nWhen I was young, I asked my mom what the word \"virgin\" meant and she responded with \"Where'd you hear that?\" as if it was a bad word. When I explained that I'd heard it in church, she relaxed and said, \"it's someone who's never loved anyone before.\" This was my confusing standard working definition until age 9, when my parents gave me and my sister a frank but extemporaneous sex talk and they defined losing your virginity as p-in-v. Currently, in my more nuanced worldview, I think virginity is when you have yet to have a sexual experience that involves the participation of another person. So, you're a virgin until you share your sexuality with someone else.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Do you consider yourself a virgin? </strong><br />\nI consider myself a virgin because I have yet to kiss someone or let someone touch me or have a sexual, physical exchange with anyone. It's not just that I haven't had penetrative sex, it's also the fact that I have never engaged in any physical demonstration of sexual desire for another person. To go back to my mom's original definition, I'm a virgin because I've never loved anyone before.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?</strong><br />\nI think the concept of virginity in our society is really confused. I think some people value it too much, others don't give it the importance that it probably does deserve. The thing that irks me about how people perceive virgins (especially the older ones). It's assumed that virgin means non-sexual and it's not true. I've had many sexual experiences on my own, getting to know my own body with masturbation.

Tell us why.<br />\n</strong><br />\n<br />\nI don't really have an opinion on whether or not I'm a virgin. I wouldn't consider myself one, but I know that some people would, because I've never had sex with a guy. I don't think that's really accurate, though, because I've definitely had sex! I first had a sexual experience with a girl when I was 14, and I wondered for years whether it 'counted' as sex, but now I don't care. I don't think of that experience as 'losing my virginity;\u2019 in fact, when I think about my sexual history, I see every single experience as being part of a gradual decrease in naivety and a gradual gaining of confidence. There has never been a 'loss' of anything. <strong></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?<br />\n</strong><br />\n<br />\nI think it's weird that people take it so seriously, especially since there are so many different ways of defining it.

It just makes them hide it, which makes them more afraid to educate themselves and be safe about it.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Anything else?</strong><br />\n<br />\nI really don't find 'virgin' to be a useful word. If I mean that someone is sexually inexperienced, I'll say that. If I mean that someone is really ignorant about sex, I'll say that (and you can be ignorant about sex even if you've had it before!). If I mean that someone is na\u00efve, I'll say that.

Having not had a proper boyfriend and my 18th birthday was nearing, I did start to look at myself and worry that it was me that was the problem. That maybe I wasn't attractive to the opposite sex, maybe I should dress like the girls who had lost their virginities, and maybe I do not need a boyfriend to fulfil this act. It's different for everyone, but personally, I do not think it was a big deal as my friends and society had told me.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Why did you wait and why did you stop waiting?</strong><br />\n<br />\nMy virginity was like a box at the back of my mind, and crept closer into my thoughts as the thought of going to University a virgin loomed. It was a big red tick on my ever growing check list in life which included lose weight and marry before 28. I figured the 'get boyfriend' note was not of huge importance as I had already done the first big milestone without having one.<br />\n<br />\nMy first time was unpleasant and I felt more relieved than anything else just to have got it out of the way.

I did not date in high school partly because I was too mature. In my junior year I could grow a full beard and was interested in religion, social and science television programs, and books. Little did I know that dating becomes more complex as one ages, and in that way I was very immature. In college I dumped my religious baggage at the dorm door. I still believed in morals\u2013being truthful, kind and good to others\u2013but not in the abstinence part. However, my focus in college was completing my degree and not getting into too much debt. Then after graduation, my focus was on finding a house.<br />\n<br />\nAt 27 I was happy. I had a house and liked where I lived, so I started to earnestly look at dating and losing my virginity. I thought dating should be easy. Dating was not easy. I had not dated before so everyone I dated was more experienced than I. Also, I was comfortable being alone, I had a house, friends, a job I enjoyed, freedom, porn, and so I did not need anyone.<br />\n<br />\nAfter dating a while, I started to get a fear of rejection\u2013not being rejected initially, but being rejected after spending time and effort, then having the relationship end before getting laid. The rejections made me ponder what my excuse for being a virgin is. I am bald but I went with it and shaved my head. I drink and party occasionally. I am 6 feet tall, 190 lbs, not gay, religious, overly shy, or a social introvert.<br />\n<br />\nSo basically I am normal and I have no good excuse except it has not happened yet. The longer I stay a virgin, the more it becomes a self-perpetuating feedback loop and the harder it becomes to break free.

I think it doesn't exist.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Why do you feel this way?</strong><br />\n<br />\nI started feeling this way when I got more involved with the LGBT community. I am not part of the community myself, but many of my friends are. I saw some of them struggle over the definition of \"virginity\" because society doesn't include people who are LGBT. The more I watched my friends struggle with this concept, the more I realized that virginity in the long run doesn't really matter. It's all relative anyway. Now as a feminist, I believe this more than ever. I don't think people should be hung up about their sexual status. It doesn't matter. <strong></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>What are your thoughts on virginity in our society?<br />\n</strong><br />\n<br />\nI think virginity in society is vastly over-rated. From white wedding dresses to purity balls, society has this obsession with female virginity and I think it's unhealthy.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Anything else you want to tell us that we didn't ask about?</strong><br />\n<br />\nI hope that as a society we can move past the concept of virginity. I feel like if we did this it would take a lot of stigma and negativity off of female sexuality. Sexuality should be celebrated, not repressed. However, as much as I want that to happen, I don't think it will in the near future. <strong></strong><br />\n<br />\n<em>Want to tell your story?

I'm actually glad that my first time wasn't with someone I was in a relationship with; it was casual sex with a friend. I think I'm glad mostly because I was extremely nervous my first time (I think it's safe to say that pretty much everyone is), and thinking about that nervousness on top of the whole \"we're taking our relationship to the next level\" idea would have made it an absolute train-wreck. Instead, it was almost like just checking something off my life to-do list; getting a milestone out of the way, which I think was very liberating. It didn't have all this weight of expectation because there was none; we were friends, and there were benefits, but there was never going to be a relationship with all the trappings of romance. <strong></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?<br />\n</strong><br />\n<br />\nI think our society is completely confused on how it thinks it should view virginity, particularly when it comes to the different sexes. For a guy, it's a mark of shame: you're not \"man\" enough to get it on. What are you waiting for? But for girls, it's this little badge of pride: \"I'm pure, I'm special, I'm saving it for someone special.\" Those ideas are shoved down our throats pretty much since the first day of sex-education, both formal and informal.<br />\n<br />\nI can respect someone wanting to not have intercourse, particularly casual intercourse, because they put value on emotional connection with their partners. In fact, I know several people quite willing to do almost everything sexual BUT have intercourse for that reason. But they do have sexual activity (fingering, oral sex, etc.) with people they like, or are building a relationship with, or even just casual partners. But it drives me up a wall when people carry on this idea of virginity, especially female virginity, as something that should be hoarded out of fear of being labeled a \"slut,\" or because sex is something to be ashamed of wanting and enjoying. Men are allowed, even expected, to masturbate and watch porn and peruse sex (casual or otherwise), but the very idea that a woman can have an active libido, and feed that libido through self-stimulation, pornography, and yes, causal-or-otherwise sex, is somehow scandalous.<br />\n<br />\nAnd at the same time, women are constantly sexualized by our media. Just look at our advertisements, especially for things like perfumes and alcohol. Women in revealing clothing or positions that suggest sexuality run rampant, yet women are expected to remain chaste. This societal mixed-signal is enough to make anyone confused.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Want to tell your story?

I grew up a very reserved child, preferring to play inside on the computer, rather than outside with...people. I guess I missed the parental and peer socialization of the concept of virginity, or at least its stressed importance. When I was 14, I dated a guy, for the first time, who was 17. He raped me and made me come to completely wrong conclusions about sex and sexuality.<br />\n<br />\nI thought that sex was about pleasing someone else. I thought my \"job\" in a sexual experience was to ensure the happiness of the other person, while my wants and needs were not supposed to exist. Rape was normalized by this relationship with him. It didn't matter that I didn't want to. The first time it happened I learned that what I wanted didn't matter. After saying no, stop, no, you're hurting me,\u00a0I was told just to calm down, and relax. To not get too graphic I was also told \"No, it doesn't hurt. I'll show you what hurts\" and proceeded to rape me anally.<br />\n<br />\nWhats worse, aside from the physical aspects, is that I thought that these experiences were sexual and relationship norms. And it's taken over 6 years for me to realize that they're not okay. They aren't and shouldn't be normal. That, what happened, was not love, like he told me repeatedly. \u00a0I don't harbor any ill will toward him individually, but I do recognize the larger problems beyond my individual case\u2014men have sex and women merely participate.<br />\n<br />\nWhen I was 18 I also entered into a marriage with someone who is very similar to the man who raped me year ago, and I was raped many times during the marriage. I hope that my story can help someone. I'm not out of the tunnel, so to speak, but I'm close to the end.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?<br />\n</strong><br />\n<br />\nWomen are not encouraged to be sexual\u2014instead, the opposite. Young women are taught to be \"pure\" (as if sex is physically and morally dirty and unclean), to be virginal. Virginity is a horrible social construct and it is treated like a universal biologically proven state of being. Virginity isn't questioned; largely, it is merely accepted as a truth.\u00a0 The virginity myth should be abolished and women's sexualities should be promoted and celebrated.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Want to tell your story?

We'd love to run it in this blog!</span><br />\n<br />\nI was only fifteen when I lost my virginity to a sixteen-year-old boy. Let\u2019s call him Steve. He was my first boyfriend and I was his first girlfriend. As such, neither of us had any experience, and yet it was magical: little candles lit the room, soft music played, he kissed me tenderly, and we both orgasmed for the very first time.<br />\n<br />\nJust kidding. It sucked. A lot.<br />\n<br />\nWhen I first learned about sex at nine years old, I was, like any other kid, completely grossed out. My mother explained intimacy to me in a scientific and matter-of-fact manner.<br />\n<br />\nMom: The penis fills with blood, becomes erect, and enters the vagina. Upon orgasm, sperm comes out of the penis and swims to the egg. One sperm out of millions fertilizes the egg.<br />\n<br />\nMy thoughts: Ew, gross! Stop telling me this. (A pause.) Wait a second\u2026you and Dad did <em>what</em>?<br />\n<br />\nAnd like any kid, I thought that <em>I</em> would never, ever do that. But the time came when I felt very strongly about someone. Steve was affectionate, funny, smart, and I trusted that he loved me. I have never been religious, was not planning on waiting until marriage, and was emotionally and physically comfortable with Steve, so why not? This sex thing was what people did when they loved and aroused each other. And of course, there was the matter of curiosity.<br />\n<br />\nI confess that I didn\u2019t know what a condom looked like, and I was a teenager just before the time when everyone began Googling everything. Due to my conservative health teacher\u2019s vendetta against premarital sex\u2014said teacher also brought in a guest speaker to lecture about the evils of abortion\u2014I was completely ignorant to matters of birth control. Luckily, Steve had had a proper sex education, so he showed me all about condoms, right down to leaving enough space at the tip for the sperm so the condom won\u2019t burst. When Steve first ripped open the little square package, I learned that condoms are not made of fabric, as I had imagined, and it suddenly made sense that sperm wouldn\u2019t leak through.<br />\n<br />\nSex at fifteen and sixteen was a secret between Steve and me for the time being. To this day, it\u2019s not something that I readily admit (oh wait, I\u2019m writing an essay about it). My instinct was to be embarrassed. When I was eighteen, that instinct was reinforced when I traveled to London for two weeks with a group of young women. My non-virgin status came up in conversation one day, and a fifteen-year-old girl couldn\u2019t believe that I had first done it at her age.<br />\n<br />\n\"I can\u2019t even imagine,\" she said, aghast. Her reaction stuck with me like glue.<br />\n<br />\nAnother time I was having ice cream with my cousin and his friends and the subject of virginity came up. I said that I had lost mine early, and was planning to leave it at that, but my cousin\u2019s girlfriend asked what my age had been. I lied and said sixteen. She said that she\u2019d been the same age and gave me a high-five. But then I felt bad about lying and added that I\u2019d been having sex for quite a while by then. Awkward laughter ensued.<br />\n<br />\nMy parental units were also informed, thanks to a false pregnancy scare. On one occasion when asked about my virginal status, I had gone so far as to look my mother in the eyes and lie. But when my dad asked I was sick of lying and told him that, yes, I was sexually active with Steve. I was not disowned, as I expected. Dad wasn\u2019t even surprised and took me home so we could tell Mom and all have a talk. (Mom wasn\u2019t surprised either.)<br />\n<br />\nBut how did the actual act of deflowering first happen for me? The idea was born when I asked Steve if he felt ready to have sex, because I did. He smiled as a tent instantly formed in his pants. A little later, we got naked, I lay down, he put on a condom, and tried to push into me\u2026<br />\n<br />\nAnd then, holy shit, <em>pain</em>. I pulled away from him. We didn\u2019t get it done on our first attempt. Or our second, or our third. Apparently my body disagreed with my brain\u2019s readiness. Every time Steve began to push into me, I yelped in pain and shoved him away, repeatedly telling him to stop. Going really slowly didn\u2019t work either, because he would just go limp. I don\u2019t recall how many times we initially tried and failed, or how many condoms we wasted. Eventually, to solve my painful dilemma, we positioned ourselves differently, he shoved his way in on the count of three, and then immediately withdrew. I snapped my legs shut and curled up in pain. I wasn\u2019t even sure whether that counted, as Steve hadn\u2019t climaxed (and obviously, neither had I). It was like we were half-virgin, half-not.<br />\n<br />\nThe next time was neither painful nor pleasurable for me, but he climaxed, and that\u2019s when I started to officially say that I was no longer a virgin. And that was my \"magical\" first successful time.<br />\n<br />\nIt took a while before I started to feel any pleasurable sensations. I would just lie there under Steve and wait while he did his thing, like a pincushion being prodded over and over again. One benefit was that tampons suddenly fit much more comfortably. But time after time, it was, just lie there and wait for him to finish, and hopefully I\u2019ll feel something aside from pain at some point.<br />\n<br />\nThen, finally, something did feel good as I lay there. Just a little sensation, at first. It grew as we practiced. But never once did I orgasm.<br />\n<br />\nI knew from masturbation what orgasms felt like, and hence I was disappointed to discover that I am one of the many girls who can\u2019t orgasm by intercourse alone. Steve and I used other methods to bring me to climax. But I still enjoy the sensations that do happen during intercourse.<br />\n<br />\nI\u2019ve never regretted having sex at age fifteen. Though we were both extremely young, Steve and I had a rare kind of first relationship in which we were committed and in love; we stayed together for four and a half years and are still friends.<br />\n<br />\nOh, and as for what became of that little chat I got to have with my parents, well, Dad wanted to clarify a couple of things\u2026<br />\n<br />\n\"Does Steve always pull out while he\u2019s still stiff?\"<br />\n<br />\n\"\u2026Yes\u2026\"<br />\n<br />\n\"Do you need condoms?\" To my horror, Dad reached over to his night table, opened the drawer, pulled out a handful, and offered them to me. As my jaw dropped and I lifted my hands to refuse them, he studied them and realized that they were expired. Would I like him to run out and buy me some more?<br />\n<br />\nOh. My. God. No, Dad, even as young as fifteen, I was capable of buying my own condoms.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Want to tell your story?

I waited till l was ready for it. I had chances in high school, including the guy I thought I was meant to be with forever. But I honestly hold sex up to a high standard. I think sex is the most intimate and important thing you can share with someone, whether you're a virgin or not. I think you not only have to trust the other person, but you have to know yourself. And I knew myself well enough to know that 14, 15, 16, even 18-year-old me was not ready to have sex. It was not something I wanted complicating my life. I finally \"lost\" it when I found someone who I trusted, who brought out the best me possible and whom I knew would be able to guide me through it.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?<br />\n</strong><br />\n<br />\nI honestly think that people hold virginity up to a higher standard then it should be.

I think SEX is a bigger deal, and should be treated like it matters. To me, it doesn't matter that some of my friends have never done it before.

I stepped back from sex with other people for years after that, and didn't even date anyone until I was 16. But I was gaining knowledge about sex, both in an academic setting and through masturbation. By most definitions of virginity I had encountered, I was still a virgin, and those of my peers who knew would treat me with disdain and infantilization and shut me down in all sexual conversation until I became more quiet and vague about my sexual \"status.\" I had PIV sex with a man at 21, and didn't feel particularly enlightened by it. I have more regular healthy sex now, and I feel like I'm still learning.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?<br />\n</strong><br />\n<br />\nI think a large portion of the way we talk about virginity is downright creepy and focuses on a) making stereotypical assumptions about people based on which side of the \"line\" they say they fall on (the virgin/whore dichotomy), and b) a very voyeuristic perspective, in which people want to know about other people's sex lives for reasons relating to gossip and speculation rather than for informative purposes or creating a beneficial dialogue.

When I told him I was a virgin he was incredulous and called me names. \u00a0I felt like shit for a while but eventually I found out he had just lost his that past summer and he was my age, so I think he was self-hating and took it out on me. \u00a0Anyhow, it was a very toxic relationship that I broke off before so much as holding his hand. \u00a0Frankly I still feel like I dodged a bullet there.<br />\n<br />\nI might fall to pieces the first time I have sex so I want it to be with someone I trust.\u00a0 I don't have time for guys who think I just have a nice rack, because guess what? When I take my bra off they sag and so he'd better be able to love that part just as much.<br />\n<br />\nI don't sleep around, drink, or smoke, but I swear like a sailor and I own a variety of sex toys that would make my mother cry if she ever saw them. I've explored my own sexuality very thoroughly, I just haven't found someone I want to share it with yet. I want companionship because even though sex is vital to romantic relationships, the novelty of it does wear off. \u00a0I also think that girls who have sex \"to get it over with\" (and I've known a few) are missing the point of sharing that intimacy between two people. \u00a0Sticking to your values is most important.

This upbringing most definitely impacted my experience with sex and sexuality.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong><br />\n<br />\nI think virginity is a dying concept that will hopefully one day be obsolete. Virginity can't be based solely on penile-vaginal intercourse. There is no way anyone could argue to me that two lesbians in a sexual relationship are virgins. The concept of virginity has been used in damaging ways for way too long. However, at the time that I \"lost\" (where did it go!?) my virginity in the \"male-penetrating-my-genitalia-with-his-genitalia\" kind of way, I did think of it as the moment I was no longer a virgin.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story:<br />\n</strong><br />\n<br />\nI was in a (seemingly) fairly healthy and communicative long-term relationship with a boy the end of my junior year of high school and through the first semester of college.<br />\n<br />\nHe was the first boy I had any sexual contact with beyond kissing.\u00a0 In a lot of ways, he taught me everything I know about sex, and our experiences inform my sex life even now\u2014in healthy and unhealthy ways. I wasn't interested in him romantically the first time that we kissed. He was a friend and I had a crush on his best friend. However, all of our friends had left for college and I figured, why not, we have to entertain ourselves somehow. Even though I was tentative on many levels, kissing him was fine and compelling. That first day he kissed me, he also fingered me for a minute. It was dry and straight all the way in, all the way out. There was nothing even remotely stimulating about it and I was terrified.<br />\n<br />\nEventually, we ended up in a comfortable sexual relationship. He took it slow, helped me figure out what I liked, bought me a vibrator (terrifying!), taught me how to use my hands too when I was going down on him. Overall it was fun and interesting and exploratory. I trusted him because he was more experienced and I thought he was in love with me.\u00a0 I don't know if I was ever in love with him.<br />\n<br />\nI didn't have penile-vaginal intercourse with him for about a year.\u00a0 I did \"everything else\" with him and thought it was fun and playful.\u00a0 But there was always the nagging. He really wanted me to have sex with him. By this time, he was 19 years old and I was 17. He had already had intercourse (apparently with 19 women, I later found out).\u00a0 To him, when you loved someone and you were in a sexual relationship with him or her, there was no reason not to cross that line. To me, it was terrifying. I was raised to believe you would go to hell if you had sex before you were married, not to mention STDs or pregnancy. Already what I was doing was questionable in the eyes of God, my parents and my religious teachers. None of my close peers were having intercourse, so they weren't helpful in providing guidance. My parents would have been horrified if they knew I was even making out with him, so I was incredibly secretive about the entire relationship.\u00a0 I had no one to comfortably talk to about sex except my boyfriend. And all he was saying was \"Get over it, let's do it!\" from day one.<br />\n<br />\nA year into dating him, on the night of my graduation from high school, it finally happened. I didn't agree to it. We didn't talk about it. I wasn't even sure what was going on. We were just making out one minute, and the next minute, we were having sex.\u00a0 No lube. No condom. No desire. No conversation. The next minute, I was sobbing uncontrollably. He hugged me and held me and told me it was okay. The problem was that once it happened, it became an expectation. The fun and playfulness of other aspects of our sexuality were cut short because it was assumed as soon as we started kissing that we would move on to \"real sex.\" I never once consented to this happening but felt trapped by the situation. There were times I would be lying on my stomach crying and he wouldn't stop. It took looking back and reflecting years later for me to know just how abusive and manipulative the relationship was.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?<br />\n</strong><br />\n<br />\nI think virginity is still unnecessarily glorified. Here is the thing: teenagers are having sexual relationships. If I wasn't made to believe it was such a huge deal, I would have been empowered to make better decisions about it, had more people to talk to, and felt comfortable with the entire concept. The idea of waiting until you are married is silly and outdated. What an awkward and unpleasant honeymoon.\u00a0 Virginity is a way to control women's sexuality and desires through societal norms.\u00a0 You can't give it away. You can't lose it. It doesn't matter. You just need to do what is right for you and take care of yourself. Everything else is nonsense.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Want to tell your story?

This was frustrating because I was a sex-educator through Planned Parenthood in high school, so there I was, teaching about birth control and STIs while I couldn't even get kissed. However, being a sex educator, knowing the facts, and teaching abstinence as an equally valid choice (even though I hadn't exactly chosen it) made me feel more comfortable with being an inexperienced virgin.<br />\n<br />\nI used to say I hoped to one day have many one-night stands, but for the First Time I wanted to be in love with the guy, because who knows how I'd react\u2014what if I fart or cry? But that view didn't last.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong><br />\n<br />\nUsually instead of defining virginity, I dismiss it as a harmful social construction. I define virginity ex post facto by if I feel like I can claim I \"lost\" it after a sexual act. There are multiple virginities, for example, for a hand job, penis-in-vagina (PIV) sex, penis-in-anus sex, phone sex, etc. And that's keeping it vanilla.<br />\n<br />\nTo define virginity by only PIV sex excludes queer sex and ignores my sexual reality, which is that I (and many women) get off on clitoral stimulation, not from vaginal penetration. I don't like a definition of sex that is phallocentric, one-sided, and doesn't factor in my own sexual agency.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story:<br />\n</strong><br />\n<br />\nWhen I was 21, I was fooling around with a boy and gave him a hand job and he orgasmed. I considered that a form of sex, yet there was nothing penetrative about it, so I felt a little uneasy telling people that I was no longer a virgin. (Interestingly, two years before, a guy touched my vagina but didn't penetrate, but I didn't consider that to be as valid, perhaps because I didn't yet think to question the validity of virginity.)<br />\n<br />\nA few months later I met a guy and really clicked with him. I had never clicked with a guy so quickly and so intensely before. On our second date I went to his place to watch a movie and ended up sleeping over, both literally and metaphorically. He put his fingers and his tongue in my vagina, and I rubbed my vulva against his penis, and after that I decided that I wasn't a virgin. I wanted to have PIV sex but he wanted to wait, out of concern that it was my first time and we weren't really together. Our relationship ended a few days later, and I regretted that we hadn't had lots of PIV sex so I could definitively end my virginity and improve my skills.<br />\n<br />\nI'm seeing someone now and have told him that I have had sex but not a lot of it. He probably assumes that means PIV sex, and I haven't corrected him yet; I'm not sure if I will. When we do have penetrative sex for the first time, I will tell him to go slow.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?<br />\n</strong><br />\n<br />\nJust because a person has had (PIV) sex once, and thus isn't a virgin anymore, doesn't mean they know what they are doing now or will be any good at it, or that sex will no longer be painful for the penetrated partner. There will always be a First Time with each new partner or sexual act, and it's always important to check in with your partner and have active consent, whether it's the first time or the 96th. Instead of thinking of virginity as this monumental milestone to take or lose or bequeath, it should just be synonymous with \"first time.\" If you do something once, so what? It's not like that makes you an expert. Keep practicing!<br />\n<br />\nAs a frustrated late bloomer, I was relieved to cast off my virginity. A part of me worried that, as a virgin, I didn't have as much credibility when I said virginity didn't matter, as if people would think I only held that view to minimize my shame of being a virgin. Now on the other side, I wonder if people will assume I discount virginity to minimize my supposed shame at not being a virgin.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Want to tell your story?

For a male to be a virgin, where I come from, is bad. For a female to be a virgin is also bad. But if you've had sex younger than a certain age, then that's also bad. I feel as though there\u2019s a time period in which to be a virgin is acceptable and when it\u2019s not.

Well, last week, right before my birthday, I finally took the plunge.\u00a0 And after I lost my virginity, I thought of three people to tell: My best friend, my college roomie and you for the blog.<br />\n<strong><br />\nHow did you lose it?<br />\n</strong>I met him at a party. I hadn't even planned on going, but my girlfriend texted and it had been such a day that I wanted to let my hair down.\u00a0 A handsome, 34-year-old Johnny Depp-type, I didn't think he'd be interested, but as the night wore on it was apparent that we needed to get out of there or risk scandalizing the other guests. We went to his place, and hooked up, but no sex.<br />\n<br />\nWe spent the next day together, had lunch, snuggled, played video games.\u00a0 That second night while fooling around, I made the \"big reveal.\" To his credit he was not incredulous, but considerate, asking how far I'd gone, and what I wanted. As things got hotter, he kept asking me, but I kept holding back (though my body's responses belied my words). Finally, going out of my mind with desire, I decided to give in to what I wanted.<br />\n<br />\nIt was unlike anything I'd expected.\u00a0 It wasn't awkward, or particularly painful. But it was unfamiliar... a sensory overload. Thankfully, I was with a guy who knew it was my first time, made communication a priority and cared about making that a good experience.<br />\n<strong><br />\nHow did you feel afterwards?<br />\n</strong>When we were done, he started stroking my face and asked how I felt. And I told him:<em> \"That was great, but I don't feel any different. I don't feel used, or broken, or in love, or guilty or like a new woman. I still feel like me...and its fucking fantastic.\"</em>\u00a0 I was worried that as much as I've progressed, some vestige of fundamentalist guilt would haunt me afterwards.\u00a0 So when it didn't, I was thrilled.<br />\n<br />\nAnd did I mention afterwards he gave me German chocolate cake? Best post-coital offering ever!<br />\n<strong><br />\nAny final thoughts?<br />\n</strong>Though I'm really into him, before we started, I gave him two conditions:<br />\n<br />\n1.

I suppose I define it as a word that is used by those too uncomfortable with themselves to accept that it just doesn't matter.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story:<br />\n</strong><br />\n<br />\nI didn't become comfortable with myself until I reached college. I'm 5'10\" and 160lbs of muscle. I always felt like I intimidated guys in high school so I never thought any of them would give me the time of day. I met Jim and started dating him. We had about four months of just straight making out before we proceeded to any of the other \"bases\" (might as well use an outdated anecdote). It was very uncomfortable because it was the first time for everything for both of us\u2014I don't remember it being uncomfortable though. We were so close, so in love. Nothing was ever weird between us. We had decided in December that we would wait until New Years Eve to \"hit a home run.\" That was probably my idea, as I was thinking it was some magical moment (**Spoiler alert!! It's not!!**). I don't know how many times I was told you can't have it back, that you'll never be able to undo the deed. Oh but I loved Jim\u2014I'm not Catholic like the rest of my family, so I was okay with sex outside of marriage, but I was still holding onto the idea that he HAD to be the one.<br />\n<br />\nAnyway, back to the sex: We didn't end up making it to January 1st. It happened on December 30<sup>th</sup>\u2014I suppose one of us was just too horny. I remember distinctly how long Jim spent in the bathroom trying to get the condom on, how there was very little foreplay, how I wasn't overwhelmed with pain, how I didn't bleed, how much longer it lasted than what I had been told, how during coitus I thought, \"this is it?\" Don't get me wrong, Jim had all the right parts and he put them in all the right places, but there was no magical moment. No fireworks (damn, I should have waited one more day!). It was there, and then it was gone. It didn't change me. It didn't change my relationship with Jim. We continued dating for another two years and have since moved on. Sure, I won't forget that specific act because it was awkward and scary and I remember lying on the bed while he was in the bathroom and I was shivering\u2014not from the cold but from all the millions of things I had been told.<br />\n<br />\nI think the best part of it all, the part that made me realize that it's society and my family and my waiting-for-marriage friends who forced me to feel that way, was a few days later after I had told my best friend, she brought me a potted plant of tulips. She said it's a ritual in her family for women to receive flowers from their mothers after they lose their virginity. I'm not sure why that meant so much to me. I suppose it was because not many people celebrate having sex outside of marriage.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?<br />\n</strong><br />\n<br />\nI think so much pressure is put on women no matter the age to act \"appropriate.\" Women aren't allowed to be sexual beings, they are only allowed to be used as such. Virginity is just one of the many ankle weights that is destroying self-esteem in so many young women. I would never say that everyone should have sex before they are married, but if we were to do away with that construct, would anyone still wait? I just think when you're ready, you should have all the pressure against you.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Want to tell your story?

It was painful and I didn't come, though I think my boyfriend did.

Through practice, my boyfriend and I ended up having pretty darn good sex, if I do say so myself.<br />\n<br />\nInterestingly, I later ended up losing my sex-with-a-woman virginity to the sexually experienced friend that I talked to on that first night. By that point I was in a relationship with her. My first experience with a woman was much more relaxed and pleasurable than my first relationship with a man.

But I got curious as to what others thought a while ago, and opinions varied widely, from orgasm, hymen breakage, loss of innocence, any sexual contact. But I suppose I still consider it vaginal penetration for a girl.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story</strong><br />\n<br />\nI'd been wanting to have sex for a while now. I was kind of sick of being the only virgin left in my group of friends from High School. So last week, I'm told by one of the guys I actually do like, (had been attracted to him for a while now, but just assumed he was never interested) that people thought I only liked one kind of guy and maybe that's why they don't hit on me. I was shocked. And annoyed. I made it clear, that is not the case. So I decided maybe now was the time to make a play.<br />\n<br />\nI've never considered sex a big deal, so I didn't need to love a guy to want it. For this, it was more like lust. Ended up going round his place. We played games, drank a bit, watched stuff, until really early in the morning. As it was raining and freezing, I couldn't exactly go home now, could I? I was aiming to stay the night regardless of if anything\u00a0 happened. I like sharing a bed with a guy, spooning is cosy. But I got more than spooning, which I am glad for.<br />\n<br />\nHe started by feeling me up, which got me the most turned on I've ever been I think. The anticipation. He seemed good with his hands though no frame of reference. He made me orgasm 2 or 3 times with his fingers. I thought I'd be really embarrassed about someone touching me down there, but I was OK with being touched by him. We made out for a while before we actually had sex. It stung more than anything. Could have been much worse I imagine. I think I got off lucky.<br />\n<br />\nSo I can tick each base off. I feel kind of bad that he did pretty much all the work though. I was a little scared to actually touch his penis, but I can work my way up to that. Fanfic has helped me thus far, taught me a lot of tricks too, which I can now start to use.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?</strong><br />\n<br />\nI think virginity values have switched. Before it used to be a good thing if you were a virgin, but now it's less valued, and if you don't lose it when you're younger, you get looked down upon. And I think that sucks. That childhood is getting invaded by things I always thought could wait till later. Losing my virginity hasn't changed me. I feel exactly the same.

I have found that I have a much higher sex drive than my partners, something which they have commented on as being 'uncommon.'

I'm about to finish my Masters Degree and find myself at a bit of a crossroads in life, including the subject of my virginity.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong><br />\nI'm of the belief that it's the first penis and vagina experience. Sure there are a wide variety of sexual activities, but from the stories I've heard I think it's the first time that really changes people.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story</strong><br />\nI've discovered that being an older virgin can result in some tricky relationships, especially if both people involved are older virgins. It's like the elephant in the room\u2013you pretend it's not there, but you cannot ignore it.<br />\n<br />\nFor the longest time I never considered it \"wrong\" to be a virgin. I don't have STDs nor religious reasons for waiting, I just felt that getting good grades and figuring out my career path was more important than getting laid. This mentality lasted me through most of my undergraduate years until I gradually realized that, at the age of 22, I was well above the \"average age\" of losing virginity. This didn't bother me\u2013my only requirement for sex is that it should be within a committed relationship (that doesn't necessarily mean marriage). Basically, no one-night stands for me.<br />\n<br />\nI have been in two relationships so far both with virgin women in their early 20s who wanted to wait. The first wanted to wait until marriage for religious reasons. The second one was more complicated. She claimed being self-conscious and scared, but after the breakup it occurred to me that she never gave me an honest answer for waiting. An interesting mystery of virginity I fear I'll never solve.<br />\n<br />\nIn both cases, I was the one that got dumped. They read me the typical riot act of things girls usually tell guys they want to break up with starting with \"I think we should just be friends,\" and ending with \"It's the hardest decision I've ever made but I hope one day you'll agree that this is for the best.\"<br />\n<br />\nAlthough I think the things they both told me were true, I wonder if *my* status as a virgin was a significant factor in the breakup. I should note that I never pressed the issue of sex in either relationship. In both cases I was wiling to wait until they were ready because I was looking for a committed relationship, not sex (though I'd have been willing to engage in it). Yet despite my sincerity to wait, I think they were afraid of hurting me. They didn't believe someone can be so selfless when it comes to sex.<br />\n<br />\nIn both cases the words \"you deserve better than me\" was said by the woman (which secretly pissed me off A LOT, that a woman would put herself down like that) Although both clarified that statement as saying our interests were growing apart, I'm beginning to think they were really saying \"you deserve someone that shares your interests AND wants sex.\"<br />\n<br />\nI am a virgin, and I'm not afraid to admit it. Yet despite my growing older, and these two failed relationships, I am still willing to wait if a future girlfriend wishes it. If that should happen again then, maybe, just maybe she'll recognize my sincerity.", "tags": [21, 90, 52, 11, 31, 9, 6, 76, 24, 56, 3, 23, 1, 54], "maxage": 25, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2012/03/first-person-matthew-i-wonder-if-my-status-as-a-virgin-was-a-significant-factor-in-the-breakup/", "date": "2012-03-15", "definition": "the first penis and vagina experience.", "aboutyou": "I'm a 25 year old male virgin living in Maryland.

I was skinny with bad acne and a bad haircut. Kids laughed at me, so I became a bookworm. I studied night and day and committed myself to school. This was in the go-go days of the mid 80\u2019s, when the movie <em>Wall Street</em> came out. <em>Wall Street </em>got me hooked on the stock market. I was 14 years old and I was reading <em>The Wall Street Journal,</em> studying charts and graphs, and talking to people about equities, commodities and currencies. I figured if girls were going to reject me, then I was going to work for a big investment bank and make a fortune.<br />\n<br />\nI was around seventeen when I first <em>really</em> <em>wanted </em>to have sex (or what most people refer to as \"horny\"). When I got out of college in 1992 I was still a virgin (and no job offers from the big investment houses).<br />\n<br />\nBy the end of the 90\u2019s my career finally took off and I was making money. I was living in Texas in 1999 when I met a girl at the TGI Friday\u2019s who liked me. She said she\u2019d meet me at TGI\u2019s the following night and we\u2019d go from there. She stood me up, and at that point I just gave up. I was so angry that I boycotted women. Call it a \"girlcott.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe next decade came and went, and when the economy tanked in 2008, I lost everything \u2013 my job, my career, my house, my company car, my 401(k). In the span of about 6 months I lost everything but my virginity.<br />\n<br />\nSince then, I\u2019ve picked up the pieces, but the damage is done. When my book came out I got some notoriety: people e-mailed me and called and said how nice it was that I was still \"pure.\" Catholics took to this; older Catholic women are very traditional and they think it\u2019s noble. Most of the e-mails I get these days are from mothers trying to set me up with their daughters, which is totally ridiculous. This isn\u2019t what I wanted for my life\u2013not exactly how I planned things.<br />\n<br />\nThey have no idea the pain and humiliation that goes with being a 42 year-old virgin. It stinks. I don\u2019t want to be a virgin anymore. It\u2019s not a good legacy. Not something to be proud of. Think about it: if I get hit by a bus tomorrow I\u2019ll go down in history as the guy who couldn\u2019t get laid. I don\u2019t want to be remembered for that.

I was in grade 11 and about to head off on my first full summer away from home without my parents when my mom decided that, in case I get raped, I should go on the pill.<br />\n<br />\nFor some reason, my mother brought me to the emergency ward of our small town hospital to get this prescription instead of to my parents family doctor. When I finally see a physician, he tells my mom that he will need to perform a pap smear. \u00a0I was cool with this, and when I think back on it, he had my health at heart and likely had to deal with a lot of young women who either kept their sexual activity a secret from their family or were uninformed about STDs.<br />\n<br />\nMy mother, however, freaks the fuck out, repeats to him and all the staff that I am a virgin (which I was, \u00a0a fact which disappoints me almost a decade later). So, after four hours spent at a hospital, we come home empty handed and mom finally calls the receptionist at her usual clinic. I get in the next day and get my pills without an exam.<br />\n<br />\nFlash forward two years later and I am in university on the opposite end of the province. My mother constantly told me that she rather I come home with an STD than an engagement ring, but the moment I mention that I'm going to change my pill prescription and have a pap appointment booked, she starts to cry on the phone, sobbing that I shouldn't let a doctor take my virginity.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong><br />\n<br />\nWell, I certainly don't agree with my mother that the doctor took my virginity, nor did I lose my virginity when I bought a hilariously oversized dildo for the sole purpose dealing with my hymen (you know, to remove my anxieties about bleeding/discomfort in anticipation for real first time sex).

Otherwise, I think I lost mine at 6 playing house in the garage. So lets go with Vaginal Intercourse.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story</strong><br />\n<br />\nI lost my virginity at 16 to my high school sweetheart who now...just so happens to be my husband.<br />\n<br />\nOur story is a romantic one. We met at 12, started dating at 15 and married at 23. We went to a nearby university and both studied education and then my husband received a masters fellowship at 23. We bought a dog and lovely cape cod with a privacy fence for a quarter of what it was going for five years ago (all thanks to the crashing economy).<br />\n<br />\nThe story of our mutual loss of virginity however, is not.<br />\n<br />\nWe were on the carpeted floor of my bedroom and my parents came home and were rummaging around the kitchen at some point. There was never any pressure on his end, any pressure I felt was purely in my own head. What if we don't stay together? What If I am sinning? (Which is funny, because I'm not what anyone would describe as a religious person) What if sucks so bad he tells people? What if he is so terrible that I will become completely turned off by him.<br />\n<br />\nThe one thing I never thought was \"What if he thinks I'm a whore\" which I'm endlessly grateful for for since it seemed to be on many of my other friends minds. We were sixteen and had already been dating for eight months. Which as most of us know is an ETERNITY when you are sixteen.<br />\n<br />\nI felt like there was so much pressure on me to make the right decision. Finally, I just decided that if this was a mistake than it was my mistake to make and that no matter what came of it. I would have no regrets.<br />\n<br />\nAs soon as I decided, I jumped him right there on a very uncomfortable carpet floor. Trust Me, he didn't mind.<br />\n<br />\nIt's funny because in a way I think making that one decision for myself helped to shape me into the person I am now. When I make decisions I always try to make ones that I can live with. After all my own virginity had nothing to do with my parents, teachers, friends or God.<br />\n<br />\nIt's my damn vagina.

Despite numerous crushes, I\u2019ve always been a shy, insecure guy, whose fear of rejection has always trumped my ability to pursue them.

That\u2019s a lot to ask, I realize, especially from someone who\u2019s never had a first date.

We'd love to run it in this blog.</span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong><br />\n<br />\nI'm an 18 year old virgin college freshman from New York.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong><br />\n<br />\nHonestly? I don't really know. For me personally, I'll lose my virginity when I am in a relationship and have vaginal intercourse with a man, which I think is pretty much the standard view. But I know virginity doesn't really exist in a solid way, and think that each person defines virginity differently, because they define sex differently. Virginity is going to be important for a very, very long time (sadly) but I think that each person owns their virginity individually, and can therefore decide for themselves what it means.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story</strong><br />\n<br />\nI went to a week-long Bible Camp for several years, and one of the biggest messages of the week was always about virginity. From the time I was ten or eleven, they started talking to us about virginity, and how important it is to keep it for marriage. They told us we would be broken messes if we ever had sex before\u00a0 marriage. That no one would want us. Of course this was directed mainly at the girls. They cited passages about marriage being when a man \"cleaves\" into his woman, which sounded kind of terrifying, because all I could think of was meat cleavers. The whole thing was a huge festival of slut-shaming and misogyny, but at the time I had no idea what either of those things even were. Unfortunately, I bought into this completely. I bought a purity ring, which I wore proudly for years. I had a holier-than-thou attitude when my friends started having sex. I don't know exactly what made me so susceptible to this whole thing, except that for some complicated reasons, I was scared of sex from a fairly early age, even before the camp. Then, through the messages from the camp, I become entirely terrified of sex. In addition, I was never the prettiest girl, and because of this, I felt that I couldn't afford to be \"dirtied\" by having pre-marital sex, because I didn't have enough going for me for anyone to ever really want me if I wasn't pure and whole.<br />\n<br />\nOddly enough, throughout all of this, I had sexual desires that I never even really tried to repress. I was accepting of it, and dealt with them myself. Somehow that never seemed wrong to me, thankfully, and I think it helped foster a comfort with my body and my sexuality that many girls who go through what I went through (and even those who don't have these experiences) don't discover. But this also made me wonder - how was I ever really going to wait until marriage to experience this thing, this be-all and end-all of worthiness and virtue which everyone was so obsessed with?<br />\n<br />\nEventually, I started to realize that my mother (who had reacted with horror when I proudly announced my abstinence pledge\u2013she had no idea that the camp was as extreme as it was and I think she felt terribly guilty about it afterwards) was right\u2013 none of this was reality-based. Though I didn't call myself a feminist until spring of my senior year in high school, I think I've been one for my entire life, because my viewpoints haven't changed so much as they have been validated by the \"feminist\" title. I always believed in female independence and autonomy, and wanted to be a strong woman who could take care of herself without anyone\u2019s help.<br />\n<br />\nAlso, due to having divorced parents, I was always kind of scared of marriage in the first place. So when my counselor one summer, a girl who was barely over 20, started telling me she was going to get married as \"as soon as God drops the right man in [her] lap,\" I was entirely horrified. But it made me realize something huge: one of the things that the abstinence movement doesn't tell you is that it's not that difficult to wait - because you're not supposed to be waiting that long. You're supposed to be getting married and starting a family as soon as possible. There I was, thinking I was going to have to wait until my late twenties at the earliest to have sex, because I never wanted to get married young, and wondering how in the hell I was going to handle all that sexual frustration, and wondering how all these other people dealt with it, when suddenly I realized that they didn\u2019t deal with it \u2013 they just got hitched right away. It changed everything for me.<br />\n<br />\nTwo months later, the ring was off. I didn\u2019t suddenly start having some wild sex life \u2013 I am still, much to my chagrin, a virgin in (almost?) every sense of the word \u2013 but I did realize that I really, really did not have to wait for marriage to have sex. I realized how ridiculous that was, and how terrifyingly cult-like the camp had really been. I have a much healthier relationship with my sexuality these days, and though I still have some residual issues left from what I essentially view as the traumatizing experience of the camp, I know that when I enter into a healthy relationship where I feel safe and comfortable, I will be more than ready to lose my virginity without much fanfare. And I look forward to it each and every day.", "tags": [69, 28, 37, 13, 10, 95, 11, 62, 17, 35, 47, 6, 5, 56, 89, 1, 118, 54], "maxage": 21, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2012/04/first-person-annie-i-felt-that-i-couldnt-afford-to-be-dirtied-by-having-pre-marital-sex/", "date": "2012-04-28", "definition": "each person defines virginity in differently because they define sex differently.

I am an \"over\" graduate student working on a new career at Evergreen State College. I am a cultural feminist; a belief in all things goddessy, kind, and generative about Feminism. And I am pro-radical honesty when it comes to issues of sex. I've dealt with being hypersexual all my life from my bipolar disorder. The subject has always interested me and enthralled me, so I know a good deal. Surprisingly it wasn't until I was 32 I was able to master having an orgasm with another person.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong><br />\n<br />\nI was born w/o a hymen so I really don't think it has much to do with a cherry getting popped or what-not. It is simply your first intercourse. But I believe it should be your first orgasm, that first moment where you were able to free yourself from all the negative messages about sex and just come together. I didn't have that till I was 25 and I wasn't really comfortable to let go with a partner in the room till 32.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story</strong><br />\n<br />\nI always attributed my loss of virginity to my lover's best friend who got me high when I was 19 and completed intercourse with me as I lay there prone and rigid in a cold blue light, like I was watching it from outside my body. I suppose it was I had so much religious shame about sex, so much taught shame that I could not say the words to describe what I needed to enjoy pleasure. I did it because of the religious mythos imparted to the act that there was some mystical bond and it would be ultimate bliss like the movies or a romance novel.<br />\n<br />\nBut it was none of that.

I really don't believe very much in \"virginity\" as a real thing. I didn't give it away or lose it. The first person I had sex with isn't walking around with it in his pocket. He's not keeping it in his sock drawer, and I'm not going to find it in the couch cushions with the lose change and lint. I don't feel any part of me was taken, and I don't feel that I'm missing anything either. My (soon-to-be) husband doesn't see me as damaged or used. I'm just me. Only thing that's different is I've had sex when previously, I hadn't.<br />\n<br />\n<strong> Tell us your story</strong><br />\n<br />\nThe first time I had it...I didn't expect it to hurt as much as it did. Holy CRAP was it excruciatingly painful. My boyfriend at the time wasn't trying to hurt me, he wasn't forcing it, he was actually going really slowly and carefully. It just hurt like a <em>mofo</em>. I'd heard from only one person that it would be painful. No one but she had ever mentioned the possibility of pain. So when I experienced it, I was well...shocked to put it mildly. Wasn't ready for that.<br />\n<br />\nI have no idea how long the experience lasted. The pain was a little too distracting to pay attention to the time. But eventually, when he got it all the way inside me, that was it. We didn't move. Just sat there with him inside and me trying not to make the pain any worse. We tried to thrust it maybe once, but it just wasn't happening. Hurt too much. In the end we just decided that it would be best for him to slowly pull back out. I don't remember if that hurt less or more than putting it in.<br />\n<br />\nIt took at least until the 5th time for it to stop hurting.<br />\n<br />\nThe first time was not magical. There was no passionate love-making or epic, orgasmic breathing and sweating. There was pain, however unintentional. I think that's something that our culture tends to gloss over. There is so much in media, video games, books, etc. that tells us that the first time is this amazing experience with fireworks and screaming orgasms and romantic declarations akin to harlequin novel character quips.

Thanks to the internet, alcohol, and public transportation I've had a lot to write about concerning sex in my blog. Both my older sisters and my mother got pregnant in their teens, so I was raised to be wary about sex.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong><br />\n<br />\nI sometimes refer to those who have not had anal or vaginal penetrative intercourse as virgins. But there is a lot of gray area, and it gets defined differently by everyone. My last boyfriend and I had anal sex before we ever had vaginal sex, but he considered himself a virgin until the day his penis went into my vagina.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story</strong><br />\n<br />\nI was 17 when I lost my virginity to a guy that I'd known for less than 24 hours. For a long time I had this idea that it would be \"okay\" to have sex once I was 18.<br />\n<br />\nEventually, thanks to Facebook I ended up with a boyfriend, 19 year old M1. We met up and I had a great time so when he asked me to be his girlfriend I said yes. We made out a lot and he couldn't keep his hands off of my breasts, even in front of his friends. He kept pressuring me to have sex two weeks into the relationship. I didn't actually like him that much, but he took me out to hang with his friends who smoked weed and had tattoos, so I just told him I wanted to wait a little longer.<br />\n<br />\nHe had a party where I met a friend of his with the same name, M2. He asked me to hang out the next day, a Sunday. M2 was 19 but didn't have a car, so he came by on his bicycle. I rode on the back and he pedaled us to his house in the next town over. He made me the best scrambled eggs I've ever had in my life, then we watched TV in his room. He was talking to another girl on his computer when suddenly he stopped and looked at me. \"You want to kiss me, don't you?\" I nodded yes, and next thing I knew we were making out and he asked me if I wanted to have sex.<br />\n<br />\nI told him I needed to think about it and laid next to him in silence for about five minutes before saying yes. I had decided that it wasn't a big deal and I liked this guy enough that I wouldn't regret it. I got on top, lowered myself slowly, and it didn't hurt too bad. I remember saying, \"I heard it hurt the first time but damn!\" It was fun, and M2 helped me figure out how to break up with M1. I did it the next day. I stayed with M2 for about three weeks. We had sex pretty much every time we were together. He claimed to not be interested in oral or anal sex. It often lasted hours...though I never had an orgasm with him.<br />\n<br />\nThen M2 went away to visit a friend who was in college four hours away. I sneaked out of my window to say goodbye to him at the train station. When he got back, I called to ask about his trip and he asked who I was. When I told him my name he asked if he could call me back. He didn't call back two hours later; I sent him a text message saying it was over.<br />\n<br />\nSince then I've had a lot of sexual adventures. I don't regret any of it; I've turned into a very sex positive, self-confident person. It took a while but I think it would have taken even longer had I waited.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?</strong><br />\n<br />\nOur society treats the concept of virginity as a measure of value.

I never really give it that much thought. I was more excited to have my first boyfriend than to lose it to him. He was in fact the first person that ever said he liked me.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story</strong><br />\n<br />\nMy virginity was lost in a Friday afternoon to my first boyfriend when I was 15. We were both so nervous that it kind of didn't go right the first time. I think he was more nervous than I was. Looking back it was a little pathetic and short and not as pleasant as sex is today.<br />\n<br />\nBut it wasn't that big of a deal, I did told my friends and it was kind of special but I didn't feel different or grown up.<br />\n<br />\nI guess it's because my sex education was completely different from the education American girls go through. The first year I entered high school I was 13, and every year until graduation we had a sex ed day. Some men and women from the public health department came into our class and taught us about condoms (they even gave us samples), diseases, pregnancy and sex in general.<br />\n<br />\nThe first year it was special since after the introduction on sex, diseases and different contraceptives methods they put girls and boys in different classes and teaches us (the girls) about our menstruation, and what we should expect our first time.<br />\n<br />\nIt was totally embarrassing and I had tons of question that of course I didn't ask because talking about sex was and is taboo. A year after the same women came back and they told us all about condoms, contraceptive methods, diseases, etc all over again but this time they add a school trip to the nearest public health center where they explain what they did, what we should do if we had unprotected sex, but more important they remark that they were here to help all of us, girls and boys, and that we could come anytime for question, revisions or the day after pill.<br />\n<br />\nI remember they seemed really nice and it was comfortable. At the end of the trip our homeroom teacher told us we will be doing an essay about contraceptive methods for men and women and diseases. So basically at the age of 14 I had to Google all about safe sex and what happens when you don't use a condom. The pictures scared me even more than I thought.<br />\n<br />\nAt the end when it was my turn, it didn't feel forced and I knew that I should use protection and where to get it. And even after I lost it those nice women came each year to my school and update us on the latest about safe sex. Because we were teenagers, at that age you are changing and your hormones are working 150% is almost impossible to prevent sex but you can make it safe.

I was raised Catholic in a politically- but not behaviorally- liberal household.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong><br />\n<br />\nThe word means little to me. I guess I would say that a virgin is someone who has not had sex. I think that the societal definition is limiting to people who aren't hetero and vague at best to everyone else. I think that my personal definition of sex includes not just the physical aspect, but the emotional closeness as well. It's so much more than just a penis in a vagina (PIV), which is the definition I knew growing up.<br />\n<br />\nI think virginity is not a particularly useful concept. And I think that the virgin/whore and slut/stud dichotomies aren't fair.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story</strong><br />\n<br />\nEr, society would say no, and I guess I'm not, but there was definitely no moment that I can look back to and say, \"That was it! That was when I lost my virginity!\" Sex for me was a very gradual progression towards coitus. I wish that there were a better euphemism for one's first time since I certainly didn't misplace my virginity, but I don't particularly care for the phrase \"giving it up\" either.<br />\n<br />\nI feel great about sex! I was 20 and this guy and I had been dating for about a year. We were getting progressively closer and closer to piv sex over that period of time. When I saw that it was imminent, I went to my doctor, got on birth control, and then he and I went on our merry way not too long after! It was the first time<br />\nfor both of us, so it was very sweet and romantic. It hurt quite a lot for a second-I bled a little- and then it felt amazing and wonderful... and then it was over. It didn't last long at all, but subsequent times only got better.<br />\n<br />\nDespite the Catholic upbringing, I miraculously have suffered no guilt from having sex outside of marriage. My first one and I broke up over a year ago, but now I'm dating a marvelous guy and we're having wonderful guilt-free sex. It's been eye-opening going from high-school-me, believing that no self-respecting people could have pre-marital sex, to where I am now in my beliefs.<br />\n<br />\nI took a class at my high school called\u2013no joke\u2013Morality. It was hammered into our heads that people who had had sex before marriage were \"damaged\" or \"used\" and would invariably regret past actions. I was surprised to find that sex I've had with someone else in the past has not diminished my sexual experiences with someone else. Catholic school had me thinking that it would matter, but I see now that it doesn't. There comes a point in a relationship when you're so emotionally close that you may as well have had sex, and when you do have sex in that scenario, it changes NOTHING. <em>Y'hear me? Nothing</em>.

I am a virgin.<br />\n<br />\n<strong> How do you define virginity?</strong><br />\n<br />\nIn keeping with the ideas of the society in which I have grown up, I would define \"virginity\", in a traditional sense, as penetrative (penis-in-vagina) sex. Where I live, having had sexual experience other than penetrative sex is pretty much seen as redundant if you haven't actually \"done the deed\". Most girls - and guys - I know probably lost their virginity at around the age of 16/17. To be any older and a virgin is seen as atypical and \"weird\".<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story</strong><br />\n<br />\nUntil two years ago, I had never really considered my virginity, or the fact that I'd had no sexual experience other than making-out. It just hadn't bothered me. But then I turned 18 and it became a \"thing\", and suddenly EVERYONE had done it except for me.<br />\n<br />\nBeing a 20 year old who has not engaged in penetrative sex is, for me, a source of shame. I think about it constantly. I am terrified people will find out. Although I have given and received oral sex, been fingered by a guy and have generally been in touch with my own sexuality since a young age, I still feel terribly inexperienced. It's become a cycle - I'm too scared to go further with guys for fear they will realise I'm a virgin and be disgusted. It makes me feel like a freak; different from my friends, inexperienced, like a child. Especially seeing as last year I traveled Europe and STILL managed to return, to the disappointment of my friends, chaste.<br />\n<br />\nI never wanted to be an older virgin, and I have had opportunities to lose it, but these were casual sex situations with people I'd only just met. I'm a deeply emotional person (with extremely low self confidence at times) and feel like I need to be with someone who I've at least met more than once. I'm getting to the stage now though that I don't really care who I lose it with/to, especially after finding out that my sister (younger by 3 years) just lost hers.<br />\n<br />\nThe thing that bothers me most about being a virgin is the stigma that is attached to it (specifically where I live), and how this serves to reinforce individual insecurities.

Who knows?<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong><br />\n<br />\n\"Virginity\" is such an outdated concept. The accepted definition intrinsically leaves out those whose sexual identities cannot be pinned down by \"penetration.\" For many, other forms of sexual intimacy are in fact more intimate than intercourse itself, and many individuals may never experience the kind of \"sex\" that most of us have internalized as \"real sex.\" Does that mean they are virgins?

Now I realize, \"virginity\" really doesn't matter. Other people's opinions don't matter either.

I've browsed through porn DVDs/manga/comics, I have books written by sex workers, drag queens and transsexuals.<br />\n<br />\nI currently follow several sexologist news streams on face book, donated pictures of my vulva to be made into vulva art necklaces and actively want a copy of the \"How To Lose Your Virginity\" DVD.<br />\n<br />\nThe only thing I have not done is have sex with a partner. I currently live out of the United States, stationed in Europe living in a military barracks, and my solo sex life could use much improvement but I have a roommate that never leaves.<br />\n<br />\nI do not participate in the party culture. I do not understand them and never enjoyed the times I *tried* to become part of them (I mention this because part of the reason why I still haven't had partner sex is because I mostly avoid being around other people. I can not imagine why this would prevent me from having partner sex. It is a mystery).<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA first time, a lack of experience. A personal evolution.<br />\n<br />\nIf you never been in combat\u2013you are a virgin. If you never been hunting\u2013you are a virgin. If you've never been out of country or state or home town\u2013you are a virgin. If you never done something before\u2013you are a virgin. Once you have, you are changed. You know. You've experienced. You've gotten out of your house and lived a life.<br />\n<br />\nVirginity is not sexual, it is experience gained and ignorance lost. We are all virgins to various forms of information and experiences. There is no shame in \"losing\" virginity, but there is shame in clinging to ignorance.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story</strong><br />\n<br />\nI am not waiting for a 'someone.' My social skills are non-existent, honestly I wouldn't know what to do with a 'someone' once I found them.<br />\n<br />\nI've heard people talk about their sex lives. Most seem to make it a point to say how much they like not like having sex. This confuses me\u2013why have sex when you do not like it? Why have sex with someone you don't even like? Why have sex and not orgasm and convince yourself that \"the Great Orgasm\" is a thing of myth and settle for an unfulfilled sex life?<br />\n<br />\nI do not like the culture of virgin bashing any more than I like non-virgin bashing. Neither one is better than the other. It makes it very hard to talk directly about sex. Because as I have never had \"the real thing\" I am an object. Something to be praised, pitied, fetishisized, blown off, lectured, condemned, to be bullied or ignored.<br />\n<br />\nBoth recent times I've been \"outed\" I ended up getting a winding lecture what I think was suppose to be a complement...to some thing (I think the guy's ego because it was more condescending then anything). The other more or lest made an offer to the tune of \"if it doesn't go in, it is not cheating\" (he was engaged) and of course, he intentions were honorable so if anything *hint* *hint* was going to happen *hint*, then *I* would be the one to initiate it.<br />\n<br />\nJust because I have not had partner sex, does not mean I am stupid. But, apparently in a way it does. I've had a lot of damage done to my thinking and ability to process information on the subject while growing up that I am working on undoing.

I consider myself an artist, a researcher, a scholar, and a student-therapist. Also, because of the body I was born with, I explode normative constructs of virginity.<br />\n<br />\nWhen I was 17 I wasn't having periods and while experimenting sexually with my then-boyfriend I became really confused. I eventually found out the reason: I do not have a uterus or a vagina. In the medical profession this is called MRKH or Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser Syndrome (named after the four men who \"discovered\" it). This is a rare congenital condition where part of the reproductive system does not develop.<br />\n<br />\nIn terms of gender, I am a woman. Genetically, I have XY chromosomes. I have ovaries and hormones, which have produced secondary female characteristics, including breasts. My vulva and clitoris look and work the same way one expects them to, except I do not have a vaginal opening. While explaining it to a guy, I once compared this to \"trying to put a penis in your armpit\". It'll give a little, but ultimately will be impossible and if you forced it, it would hurt.<br />\n<br />\nAt first I was really upset because I still thought of myself as a \"virgin\" and suddenly realized I had nothing to \"give away\". I remember thinking, \"I have gone as far as I can, and now what?\" This part of my identity has forced me to find a new definition for a lot of cultural constructs, including sex.<br />\n<br />\nI love sex. I find many forms of sex pleasurable in the context of a consenting and intimate relationship with another person. It's just that when I say \"sex\" it means something other than what most people think of as \"sex\". One of the challenging parts is having to discuss my situation with men because it requires them to challenge their assumptions and expectations as well. They have an image of \"sex\" that doesn't exactly correlate with how I think of it, which I sometimes forget until I am getting serious with someone and I have to take a \"time out\" to explain. Sure, it's awkward, but it also creates a dialogue about sex that I might not otherwise take the time to have.<br />\n<br />\nI've come to think about my virginity as a period of my life prior to my first \"sexual experiences.\" I fondly remember curiosity and self-exploration, but also anxiety and confusion. If I thought of \"virginity\" in terms of a physical state, then I never have been or ever will be a virgin. Now I think of it along a continuum of first experiences, from my first kiss, to my first time being touched or touching another person intimately, being naked with someone, first orgasm and sexual pleasure, and the feeling of having part of someone inside my body. I think it's a combination of first physical, emotional, and psychological experiences that over time have become part of my personal narrative.<br />\n<br />\nI associate virgin with something I thought I had to be, but now I think the word \"virgin\" is just a way to make us think we're not supposed to be sexual beings. In contrast, I think of \"first times\" as the people, the moments, the feelings, and sensations. I could talk about how I missed out on having a \"first time\", but I would rather take it as an opportunity to talk about how my body helped me redefine \"first time\" to be what was meaningful for me.", "tags": [121, 69, 64, 132, 126, 84, 85, 34, 95, 62, 104, 16, 94, 76, 7, 5, 66, 81, 1, 46], "maxage": 23, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2012/06/first-person-erinn-how-do-i-lose-my-virginity-if-i-dont-have-a-vagina-how-my-body-helped-me-redifine-my-first-time/", "date": "2012-06-28", "definition": "a continuum of first experiences from first kiss to first time \nbeing touched or touching another person intimately, being naked with \nsomeone, first orgasm", "aboutyou": ""}}, {"pk": 108, "model": "firstperson.story", "fields": {"firstgraf": "Our latest First Person comes from Elizabeth in Illinois, who describes how being queer and a virgin has made her feel ashamed and isolated.

It feels like a slap in the face to me.<br />\n<br />\nThe kicker? Men hit on me a lot.

Somehow I knew I could trust him and within the first few weeks I told him everything about my darkest secret: I was molested by a family member several times when I was younger. I really think this affected the way he treated me in our relationship when we started dating five months later. He was insistent that sexual doings weren't necessarily bad or scary, and of course that we should do them (horny teenagers right?). That was the full extent of the pressure he put on me to have sex.<br />\n<br />\nShortly before we started dating we went to prom together, but he didn't dance \"on\" me. He was worried about scaring me away if I felt a certain part of him. Six months after we started dating, we explored each other's bodies. Though we had talked about it earlier and I agreed to it, he still asked to touch me, and asked again when things went lower. Because of all the stuff out there about girls' first times being unpleasant, he asked me to at least try masturbation.<br />\n<br />\nA year after we began dating we decided on partial penetration. It didn't work out too well. I started going a bit too far but he held back, unwilling to violate our earlier agreement. The next day he did go farther, but still not enough. I said we had already passed our earlier agreement anyway, so why hold off? He wholeheartedly agreed, and it was nice (with a condom, of course).<br />\n<br />\nI did not orgasm then, to his credit he did try to make me after he did. But I only began to get sore. I did cry afterwards; not because I wasn't a virgin anymore, but because I didn't want him to go. So he held me. There weren't any huge sparks and I still didn't orgasm for quite awhile after that, but I loved each time. Plus it only got better, and better, and better.<br />\n<br />\nTo this day, he's still careful about hurting me emotionally during sex. I could tell him to stop at ANY point and he would.<br />\n<br />\nBut don't think of him as a sweet wuss with no backbone. He looks at me like he's going to eat me and has no qualms about pushing me onto the bed and various other things of that nature.<br />\n<br />\nIt occurred to me while reading other first-time articles that mine seems unusually good. I can't believe the unfeeling way some people were treated. It's especially saddening/angering to see that it was/is thought to be normal. I wish more people could have had better first times, more caring partners. He helped heal the scars left from when I was younger and aided my education about safe-sex. I was his first everything. While I'm thankful he was my first kiss and lover, I wish so much that he could have been my first everything as well.<br />\n<br />\nI honestly believe first times are important, not just for sex but for anything we do. Anybody remember a first plane ride? first pet? Sometimes first times suck, but we learn from them. I learned to stick up for myself and then learned how wonderful sex can be.", "tags": [84, 116, 64, 86, 126, 69, 63, 95, 62, 34, 61, 17, 94, 16, 47, 88, 5, 59, 58, 131, 1], "maxage": 18, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2012/06/first-person-scarlett-i-learned-to-stick-up-for-myself-and-then-learned-how-wonderful-sex-can-be/", "date": "2012-06-27", "definition": "when a vagina is fully penetrated by a penis", "aboutyou": "I'm nearly 18, a college freshman majoring in Interior Architecture and living in the US"}}, {"pk": 119, "model": "firstperson.story", "fields": {"firstgraf": "Our latest First Person comes from AJ in India, a shy man who fears a sexual relationship due to negative reinforcements from his mother.

I lost my virginity at\u00a020, and I've recently decided to abstain until marriage on my own terms.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong><br />\n<br />\nFor me, first PIV (penis-in-vagina)\u00a0sex. There are so many\u00a0gray areas and exceptions that I could never define virginity for anyone\u00a0else but myself.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story:</strong><br />\n<br />\nI've always considered myself sexually aware and\u00a0discovered masturbation in my early teens. In my second year of college I\u00a0was brave enough to purchase a vibrator, which made me feel awesome about\u00a0myself and empowered. I considered my sex life as a virgin very fulfilling\u00a0and because of that I thought I was ready to have intercourse.<br />\n<br />\nThe young man I lost my virginity to was in the same major as me and we\u00a0both worked at the TV station on campus. Over the course of two weeks I started exploring with him, and to his credit he stopped whenever I wasn't\u00a0ready to go further. The night I lost my virginity, I was the one who\u00a0asked to have sex. I was scared and nervous, which I didn't tell him. He\u00a0thought I was mature and empowered (I was! but also scared and vulnerable)\u00a0and he didn't think virginity was a big deal to me. The sex was not great\u00a0or special; I was too nervous to enjoy myself and cried myself to sleep\u00a0afterwards. I was devastated and was depressed for several months\u00a0afterwards.<br />\n<br />\nLooking back on it now, I know why I became depressed. A question kept\u00a0nagging me: \"If I am so comfortable with my own sexuality, why was having sex for the first time such a big deal that it broke me emotionally?\" Right? I enjoyed my sexuality as a virgin so much and was so satisfied.\u00a0But bringing another person into the equation was so much less enjoyable -\u00a0why?<br />\n<br />\nI can tell you now that I was NOT emotionally ready to be intimate with\u00a0someone else. My ideal of being able to do whatever I pleased sexually\u00a0fell short of the pressures that society (aka, my peer group) immediately\u00a0slammed on me. \"What?! You lost your virginity to some random guy?\" \"It\u00a0wasn't even special?\" \"He doesn't even want you to be his girlfriend?\" Not\u00a0to mention that I had to hide all of this from my family and friends back\u00a0home, so what I was originally excited about turned out to be a source of\u00a0shame and lies. I found myself isolated and heartbroken. It was a really\u00a0shitty situation.<br />\n<br />\nThe silver lining of this is that I learned a lot about what sex and\u00a0virginity means to me. My \"virginity\" is long gone, and as far as I'm\u00a0concerned, good riddance! The most important thing I've learned about\u00a0myself is that just because I'm sexually aware of myself and feel\u00a0empowered, I do NOT have to be ashamed of wanting sexual intercourse to be\u00a0special and important, and reserved for marriage. I've heard a lot of\u00a0mixed messages telling me otherwise. (If you're a virgin, you should be\u00a0pure and innocent and non-sexual until marriage. Oh, but that means you're\u00a0a prude. If you're sexually empowered, you should have sex whenever and\u00a0with whoever you want. Oh, but that means you're a slut. All of these are\u00a0lies and myths taught to us by society.)<br />\n<br />\nI hope that my story will reach someone out there and help them feel like\u00a0they're not alone, and don't have to be ashamed of what sexuality and virginity means to them!", "tags": [57, 49, 101, 69, 73, 15, 107, 27, 105, 95, 62, 10, 11, 31, 79, 16, 47, 7, 5, 93, 2, 1, 139, 54], "maxage": 22, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2012/08/first-person-anna-because-im-sexually-aware-of-myself-im-not-ashamed-of-wanting-intercourse-to-be-for-marraige/", "date": "2012-08-16", "definition": "penis in vagina sex", "aboutyou": "I'm a 22-year-old female living in New York and\u00a0I'm starting my senior year of college this fall.

I used to think the loss of virginity was a clear milestone for heterosexual females like myself-- the first time one willingly engages in penetrative vaginal sex-- but now it doesn\u2019t seem so simple. As someone who made the deliberate decision to have vaginal sex but was physically unable to do so, I don\u2019t know whether or not to call myself a virgin or not. Which matters more, the intention or the act itself?<br />\n<br />\nIt also seems a little ridiculous to claim the label \"virgin\" when I have an active sex life of oral and outercourse and orgasm more frequently than some of my friends who lost their vaginal virginity years ago, but the cultural significance of vaginal virginity is pervasive and hard to just throw away or ignore, especially when it's the standard by which so many other people define it.<br />\n<br />\nI often say I'm in \"Virgin Limbo\"; I don\u2019t feel right identifying as a virgin OR not a virgin. I think the definition of virginity needs tweaking to account for situations like this.<br />\n<br />\n<strong> Tell us your story</strong><br />\n<br />\nUntil I was 22 I was a virgin because I was waiting for the right person. My first kiss was at 18 and my first boyfriend at 19, but in college I never dated anyone long enough to feel the comfort and trust I considered a prerequisite. However, just shy of my 22nd birthday, I met him. We had been dating a few months when I decided that our relationship-- and, most importantly, I personally!-- was ready.<br />\n<br />\nThe night leading up to it was perfect. There was a rooftop sunset, spontaneous fireworks display in the distance, and making out in the rain; if it had been in a movie, you'd have rolled your eyes at how \"unrealistic\" it was. We went back to his room with some condoms and went for it.<br />\n<br />\nExcept . . . \"it\" didn't happen. I was more than ready when he tried to enter me, but it felt like he was like he was trying to thrust against a wall-- a wall that felt sharp stabs of pain every time it was hit! I normally have a very high tolerance for pain, so I couldn't believe this was supposedly what every girl feels her first time, especially since he hadn\u2019t even entered me more than a half-inch. I tried loosening things up more with more lube and orgasming first but it didn\u2019t make a difference. I was so frustrated I was ready to force through the pain, but my partner had been with a virgin before and knew it wasn't supposed to be so difficult or painful, so we stopped.<br />\n<br />\nIn the following months we sought advice from trusted friends and the Internet alike and were given suggestions from extra lube to getting drunk. But the only thing that actually helped was a name we discovered: vaginismus, a condition in which the pubococcygeus (PC) muscles at the opening of the vagina involuntarily close and painfully resist the entry of foreign objects, from tampons to penises. It explained everything: why I'd always hated using tampons, why I'd cried in pain during my one and only pelvic exam, and why I couldn't have sex. I wasn\u2019t \"unusually tight\" as I\u2019d once believed; penetration objectively hurt me in ways it doesn\u2019t hurt most people, thanks to muscle spasms I can't control. It\u2019s still a mystery why I have vaginismus, but knowing what it is has lead to information on how to fix it.<br />\n<br />\nFast forward two years later. I'm still with the same partner and thanks to open minds and a few compatible kinks our sex life is plenty satisfying, but vaginal sex is still a distant dream. I've seen a doctor and gotten advice on relaxation techniques, Kegel exercises, vaginal dilation, and insight on what muscles to move and how, but while things seem to be progressing, it\u2019s slow-going. It\u2019s frustrating that what is so natural and pleasurable for most people is painful and a chore for me, something I have to \"work on\" in an unsexy clinical way. There\u2019s enough promise in what we have achieved that we haven\u2019t given up and eagerly await the day we can have vaginal sex, but for now, I\u2019m still stuck in \"Virgin Limbo.\"<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;", "tags": [37, 121, 64, 126, 69, 132, 86, 10, 95, 62, 26, 9, 140, 16, 6, 7, 5, 81, 1, 46], "maxage": 24, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2012/08/first-person-a-because-i-have-vaginismus-i-often-say-im-in-virgin-limbo/", "date": "2012-08-20", "definition": "an active sex life of oral and outercourse and orgasm", "aboutyou": "I'm a 24-year-old heterosexual female living in the US."}}, {"pk": 116, "model": "firstperson.story", "fields": {"firstgraf": "Our latest First Person comes from Brook from Minnesota, who enjoyed losing her virginity, but wishes she was more compassionate to herself as a virgin.

My relative virginity ebbed and flowed depending on my mindset and philosophy. I tend to think now that it's not easy to decide who IS a virgin: it's a lot easier to pick out someone who is NOT a<br />\nvirgin. So, basically, my own personal philosophy is that you're not a virgin anymore when you no longer feel like a virgin, when you've<br />\nundergone some kind of experience (any kind) that makes you feel different, like you've crossed a milestone, or that makes you sufficiently knowledgeable or experienced that it would feel silly to call yourself a virgin.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story:</strong><br />\n<br />\nI lost my virginity relatively recently at the age of 24. A classic late bloomer, I had been waiting so long for the \"right guy\" or the \"right moment\" that I had suddenly found myself in my mid-twenties and still a virgin. I started to feel ridiculous and ashamed of my prolonged abstinence. It felt like a failure, like I had missed some landmark that I should have passed by now. This was despite the fact that I had many friends who were also still virgins or who had been virgins into their twenties -- we talked about this frequently but were somehow never able to find any solace in our shared fate.<br />\n<br />\nFinally, I had decided I was pretty sick of being ashamed and of holding back and of waiting. So one night, while feeling particularly attractive and happy, I drank my fair share of gin and tonics and went to bed with a friend of a friend, someone I liked and trusted but was by no means in love with. I'm not saying the decision was easy. I had spent so much of my life holding back and running from sex that it was a hard habit to break. But after a little motivational speech in the bathroom mirror, I had sex and it was fun. I didn't tell him I was a virgin and I have no reason to believe he had any \"suspicions\" (which is actually how I thought of it -- I was a fraud, pretending to be someone that I wasn't, pretending to know what I was doing when I didn't).<br />\n<br />\nWhen it was over, my first reaction was one of elation and relief. It turned out that this was as close to the \"right guy\" and the \"right moment\" as I could have hoped for under the circumstances. But I also felt a little annoyed that I hadn't done it sooner. The fact that I was a virgin had stopped me from having sex many times. Mostly, I had been terrified of being rejected when a potential sexual partner found out my dark secret. But now the milestone had passed, I wished I'd gotten it over with a lot sooner and saved myself the psychological agony, the years of feeling shame and embarrassment.<br />\n<br />\nI still feel this way, but another regret has wormed its way into my conscience and has surprised me. In part due to conversations with friends who admitted never \"owning\" their virginity and in part due to discovering <em>How to Lose Your Virginity</em>, I am now beginning to regret that I was never able to be comfortable with my virginity. It's not that I should have been proud of it \u2014- because, honestly, that would have been asking too much. I wish that I could have at least been more compassionate with myself for being unable or unwilling to have sex before I did. I would be going too far to say that I wish I was still a virgin so I could find that piece of mind. I had fun losing my virginity, but I do wish I found the strength within myself to be happy as a virgin and to fight back against the nagging feeling that I was somehow broken because I hadn't managed to have sex. I hope <em>How to Lose Your Virginity</em> can help others like me find that self-confidence and inner peace that I never found.", "tags": [39, 91, 21, 77, 73, 15, 20, 95, 62, 10, 141, 17, 7, 16, 5, 3, 1], "maxage": 24, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2012/08/first-person-brook-i-wish-i-wish-id-gotten-it-overwith-sooner-and-saved-myself-the-years-of-shame-and-embarrassment/", "date": "2012-08-21", "definition": "when you no longer feel like a virgin, when you\u2019ve crossed a milestone that makes you sufficiently knowledgeable", "aboutyou": "I'm 24 years old, and I currently live in Minnesota."}}, {"pk": 120, "model": "firstperson.story", "fields": {"firstgraf": "Our latest First Person comes from Bethany in Michigan, who thinks virginity signifies the power that society has over women and their bodies.

I promised myself that I would not lose my virginity before I left high school because I was scared SHITLESS of becoming pregnant and ending up like the other girls in my class: teen moms with babies and, in my petty mind, no future. \u00a0So, in a sense, as a younger and not-so-feminist version of me, I saw my virginity as something to hold on to because it would get in the way of my success, thus defining my womanhood through this single sexual act. \u00a0I now see that I used it as a way to distinguish myself from an identity I longed to escape. \u00a0Now I see that virginity=power, and, sadly, I think it signifies the power that society has over women and their bodies.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story:</strong><br />\n<br />\nI was in a monogamous relationship with my high school sweetheart; let's call him \"Chad\". \u00a0We had fooled around during our two year tryst, but no serious business and no sex. \u00a0The minute I packed up for college, I had sex, sex, sex on the brain and I knew it was on his<br />\ntoo. \u00a0Although we never made an official plan, we both knew we were going to lose our virginities when he came up during my first week of school for a big football game, and our first time without \"adult\" supervision.<br />\n<br />\nWe, being the classiest of couples, booked a hotel room in a town near my college. \u00a0Before he arrived, I did what was expected of a girl losing her virginity: bought matching underwear (which, by the way, was going the extra mile because I wore sports bras from age 11 to age 17). \u00a0I dressed in my cutest outfit, put on more make-up than I had ever had, and packed an overnight bag with my sexiest sleep shorts and tank top (I still don't wear negligees...).\u00a0 On the 20 minute drive to the hotel, my mind raced with expectations and fears, with the pervasive thought of \"FUCK, FUCK, FUCK, I should have grabbed condoms from the health center before I left\".<br />\n<br />\nWe arrived at the hotel, paid up front (with my credit card, by the way) and proceeded upstairs. We entered into the stale-smelling room with the yellowed ceiling and the green-flowed bedspread that make all cringe. \u00a0We looked at each other, shrugged, and proceeded to make out. \u00a0He was the first person I had ever undressed in front of and, to be honest, neither one of us had a fucking clue what we were doing. \u00a0But, at one point, probably before the pants came off, I said, \"Dude, we need to stop and get condoms\" and Chad's simple response was to grab a box of Trojans from his duffle and chuckle as he said, \"I came prepared\". \u00a0We finally figured out how to put it on him and when he slid into me, I laughed because I didn't know what else to do.", "tags": [44, 69, 77, 20, 31, 26, 95, 62, 34, 47, 88, 16, 5, 2, 1, 139], "maxage": 24, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2012/08/first-person-bethany-i-did-what-was-expected-of-a-girl-losing-her-virginity-i-bought-matching-underwear/", "date": "2012-08-30", "definition": "virginity=power, the power that society has over women and their bodies", "aboutyou": "I am 24 years old, and I live in Ann Arbor, Michigan."}}, {"pk": 121, "model": "firstperson.story", "fields": {"firstgraf": "Our latest First Person comes from Lena, am 18 year old woman from London, England, who got over her Catholic guilt to maintain a casual, sexual relationship .

For some reason, I don't consider oral sex to be sex\u00a0(although I actually didn't partake until after I'd lost my virginity\u00a0anyway).<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story:</strong><br />\n<br />\nIn my second week of university, I went clubbing with\u00a0some friends, but I'd accidentally left my ID at home. I farewelled them\u00a0and went to a bar with some other friends, who were more willing to just\u00a0go to places I could actually get into. Anyway, we were in this dark,\u00a0sleazy bar and I was buying a mojito, and all of a sudden I couldn't see\u00a0my friends. Then a guy sidled up to me - his name was Alex. I made out\u00a0with him for most of the night after that, and then he offered to take me\u00a0back to his place, but I refused. I got his number though.<br />\n<br />\nA couple of days later, he texted me. I was sick of being a virgin, so I\u00a0agreed to go to his house. I knew what \"fooling around\" entailed, and he\u00a0seemed exceptionally keen. So was I. It hurt a bit, but it lasted for a\u00a0long time and he had endless fun teaching me all sorts of positions.\u00a0Despite the initial pain and slight ache (I later described intercourse as\u00a0\"having your insides assaulted with a blunt instrument\"), I enjoyed it. It\u00a0wasn't special, but it was enjoyable, and I think that was what counted.<br />\n<br />\nAfter a few weeks stewing over my Catholic guilt, I saw him again. We now\u00a0meet up most weeks. While occasionally I grapple with the realities of such a casual relationship, I don't mind, and for the most part it is\u00a0enjoyable experimentation.<br />\n<br />\nHe didn't tell me his age until afterwards though.

I am currently living in Las Vegas, but originally from California.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong><br />\n<br />\nNever acting in a more platonic way to a person of sexual interest. Having never kissed someone, I believe there are several types of virginity.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story:</strong><br />\n<br />\nI will be 21 in less than a week and I am still a virgin. I have never even held hands with a guy. I was always the different one in school, and I've done most of my life backwards. I was the ugly duckling in high school, and I haven't grown into the \"swan\". I graduated high school at 16, and college at 18. At that point I didn't put pressure on myself to get a boyfriend; I naively thought that it would just happen.<br />\n<br />\nAfter college I moved to Paris, also known as \"the city of love\", for everyone but me. Even abroad, there wasn't a single person I was interested in. I moved around some more and finally ended up in Vegas, the single most disgusting city in the world (seriously, the locals here are like characters from a Rob Zombie film). Alas, I am eager to lose my virginity as 21 is really pushing it, but the problem is I have no guys who are interested. I am on several online dating sites, and no bites.<br />\n<br />\nI keep myself up, and I'm not the worst thing out there, but it's very competitive. I'm also very tall and severe looking so that intimidates guys a lot. Being a virgin sucks simply for the fact that having sex is the most primal and normal of basic humans needs. To be a female and not be able to attract a guy for sex is really saying a lot. If I can't get a guy now while I am young and fertile, how am I going to get a guy when I'm older?<br />\n<br />\nI think the media puts so much pressure on people about sex, because it's everywhere. Every ad has a sexual inneundo. Sex sells, especially in Vegas, and not being able to participate is like being deprived of water simply because the cap is still sealed. I've recently begun to think about losing it to a random guy in a bar to get it over with. I honestly don't think I'll have a boyfriend so there's no point in waiting for something that is never going to happen.<br />\n<br />\nBeing a virgin in today's society is more of a burden then a \"gift\", and the idea of being pure is a novelty that has run dry. How can someone be pure in this world when sex is all around us even if it's not happening to us? I don't think people should wait for that \"special someone\", because life is not a fairy tale, it is what you make of it. It's a experience that everyone should get the pleasure of trying, and to have to resort to uncomfortable measures as going to a bar is definitely a low point. Losing it in high school would probably be the easiest and safest way.<br />\n<br />\nIf I could say one thing to my former high school self I would say, \" you only live once, you might as well do it right the first time, find a guy, be safe, and enjoy. If you wait too long, you'll be too tall to ride, and life's tickets will run out.

My view would be that losing your virginity is having vaginal intercourse, but I have heard virginity defined in many ways (anal and oral).<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story</strong><br />\n<br />\nIt seems that after 18 years, I am still a virgin as a freshman in college. Before college, I had not had much education about virginity, sex, etc, To educate myself, I looked up certain terms that I heard people refer to, and eventually I did look up porn, but sex seemed so out there for a senior in high school. So, until I made it until college, sex did not really mean anything and losing virginity seemed to<br />\nbe on the back burner of my mind.<br />\n<br />\nThis all changed as soon as I went to college. I was thrown into the drinking, social scene culture of college where guys and girls could<br />\ncasually have sex and be totally fine with it. Of course, alcohol reinforced this culture. What was I going to do as a virgin trying to navigate through this culture where being a freshman is one of the most desirable things for guys to prey on?<br />\n<br />\nSomething like virginity that seemed so abstract to me before college turned into a top priority for me. I heard stories about how even the most unsociable people were \"getting it in\" as I remained a complete \"prude.\" I wanted to lose my virginity as I slowly became more and more horny, but I did not want to partake in the drinking culture that resulted in possible sexual assault or health complications due to alcohol (something my mother also advocated against).<br />\n<br />\nI was close to losing it with a guy who seemed a little happier than he usually was, but nothing came out of it. I worry about the day when I do choose to lose the big V. What happens if the guy is a pro with sex and I am the noob? What happens if it is not what I expected? Will it ever happen? Until it happens, the questions have yet to happen but I hope that the big V will be taken before I become the prude/noob I fear that I might become.", "tags": [44, 42, 69, 117, 15, 20, 26, 31, 34, 9, 6, 47, 5, 59, 2, 1, 139], "maxage": 18, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2012/08/first-person-hob-virginity-seemed-so-abstract-to-me-until-college-turned-it-into-a-top-priority/", "date": "2012-08-25", "definition": "having vaginal intercourse", "aboutyou": "I am a 18 year old college student in New Hampshire."}}, {"pk": 122, "model": "firstperson.story", "fields": {"firstgraf": "*Trigger Warning* These are not your average First Person narratives.

I think virginity in terms of sex is the moment you have sex with\u00a0someone and you realise that you feel really comfortable with them and you're\u00a0not being self-conscious about how you look, how much noise you're making,\u00a0what he's thinking, etc. It's the divide between not knowing yourself and\u00a0knowing yourself, if that makes sense.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story:</strong><br />\n<br />\nI had been talking to my sister and realised that I\u00a0didn't want to still be a virgin when I was 25, so when I finally got my\u00a0first boyfriend at 21 I decided that sex was on the cards. About three\u00a0months into our relationship he looked at me like I was an alien when I\u00a0told him I was still a virgin.<br />\n<br />\nThen, when we finally did get around to having sex, it was extremely\u00a0painful for me and I asked him to stop. The relationship from then\u00a0revolved around him asking for sex and me being extremely reluctant\u00a0because sex with him was unpleasant and I always felt pressured to have\u00a0sex with him even when I didn't necessarily want it. Eventually we had a\u00a0massive argument because he thought I should just 'get over it' and, to\u00a0steal a phrase from another one of your 'First Person' stories, I\u00a0basically told him that it was my vagina and he could go screw himself.<br />\n<br />\nSo on the whole I probably should have waited a little longer and chosen\u00a0my partner more carefully. I didn't think my partner would be an issue\u2013after all, all boys have penises, right, and there's only so many things\u00a0you can do with it\u2013but I realise now that my virginity wasn't\u00a0necessarily about having sexual intercourse for the first time but about\u00a0having some sort of meaningful intimacy with a partner, regardless of what\u00a0sort of relationship you have with them outside of that moment.<br />\n<br />\nHaving had a .... disappointing first sexual encounter isn't a barrier\u00a0though. I am, and have always been, extremely happy to talk about sex with my friends. I am not shy with my viewpoints and I have a very active solo\u00a0sex life that has definitely given me the time to find out what I want,\u00a0what I like and what I don't. I haven't been hanging out for a new man\u00a0waiting to sweep me up and make sweet, passionate love to me because\u00a0frankly that's unrealistic (unlike other female members of my extended\u00a0family who are extremely religious and are always telling me to \"grab\" a\u00a0man because I'm not going to be young and pretty forever, you know).<br />\n<br />\nI also don't necessarily believe that being in a committed relationship is\u00a0the only way to have sex. I recently had the best sex of my life with\u00a0someone I'd only known for a week. It's not going to develop into anything\u00a0further but that doesn't lessen the fact that I had a very meaningful\u00a0sexual relationship with him. And all of this is stuff I wouldn't\u00a0necessarily have concluded if I hadn't had my experiences with my first\u00a0boyfriend.", "tags": [126, 107, 69, 86, 20, 34, 62, 10, 95, 94, 16, 8, 5, 3, 2, 66, 1, 46], "maxage": 23, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2012/09/first-person-alexa-i-basically-told-him-that-it-was-my-vagina-and-he-could-go-screw-himself/", "date": "2012-09-06", "definition": "when you feel really comfortable with someone having sex,  the divide between not knowing yourself and knowing yourself", "aboutyou": "I'm a 23 year old University student from Australia."}}, {"pk": 124, "model": "firstperson.story", "fields": {"firstgraf": "Our latest First Person comes from Lana from New Zealand, a woman who wanted to regain control of her life before losing her virginity.

I am not a virgin.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong><br />\n<br />\nVirginity to me has always been in the\u00a0physical sense. Losing one's virginity consists of having penetrative\u00a0sexual intercourse or the equivalent thereof if you aren't heterosexual.\u00a0I'm not religious, nor was I brought up that way, so I tend to see things\u00a0like that in more of a scientific, straight forward light.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story: </strong><br />\n<br />\nI was quite a troublesome kid when I was younger. I ran\u00a0with a bad crowd and I did a lot of dumb things such as developing a\u00a0drug dependency when I was 15. My parents were very busy when I was\u00a0younger; my mum worked nights as well so I could get away with a lot of\u00a0stuff without them ever knowing what was going on. I lost pretty much all\u00a0control of my life at that point, apart from my virginity. I wanted to\u00a0hold on to that one piece of me that I felt was the only thing I had going\u00a0to keep me somewhat happy with myself.<br />\n<br />\nMost of the people I hung out with\u00a0were older and sexually active (had been for a while) and used that to\u00a0their advantage. I always tended to be the younger one in the group, so\u00a0eventually to stop from getting teased or disowned by my \"friends\", I lied\u00a0when I was 16 that when I'd gone away for summer, I'd lost my virginity. I\u00a0had a whole story, got the guy (who was one of my only decent friends) to\u00a0agree to go along with it if they ever asked or caught up with him about it. I managed to keep that story up with\u00a0most people to this day. Because I live in a relatively small city\u00a0compared to other countries, my friends now are people I've known almost\u00a0my whole life. So most of my friends now assume that I did lose my\u00a0virginity when I was younger like they did, and I've never had the\u00a0courage to correct them.<br />\n<br />\nOnce I ended up getting my shit together and got off the drugs, I was\u00a0about 18. I met a guy and all of our friends became a group who hung out a lot. One night, there were a few of us around at his house and they\u00a0decided to go looking for some food. Us two decided to stay back. I don't\u00a0even know why, I was never really attracted to him in that sense until\u00a0that night when he kissed me. It didn't go much further, and we just slept\u00a0in the same bed. My reputation, unfortunately, proceeded me and after\u00a0hanging out for about 6 months with no luck (obviously), he finally asked\u00a0me if I was a virgin after all. I owned up, said yes, and he said he'd\u00a0wait for me. And he did, for at least a year and a half after that\u00a0conversation.<br />\n<br />\nLooking back, he was amazing about it and I wish more guys\u00a0would be able to do that for girls. When I had just turned 20, I felt\u00a0ready in myself and the fact that I had control over my life again made it\u00a0easier for me to give that part of me up for good. I never would have done it had I felt I wasn't healthy and prepared to remain\u00a0healthy, which I have so far. I'm 4 years and 3 months sober, and I am\u00a0still friends with the guy I lost my virginity with. It was\u00a0uncomfortable, but I don't regret it one bit and I'm so proud of that\u00a0fact.", "tags": [21, 42, 86, 73, 39, 15, 10, 17, 62, 16, 5, 58, 66, 1], "maxage": 22, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2012/09/first-person-lana-i-lied-when-i-was-16-that-when-id-gone-away-for-summer-id-lost-my-virginity/", "date": "2012-09-11", "definition": "having penetrative sexual intercourse", "aboutyou": "I'm a 22 year old female and I'm from New Zealand.

I'm 30 (about to be 31), female, and I live in Sydney, Australia.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How do you define virginity?\u00a0</strong><br />\n<br />\nWhen I learned about sex, I was taught it was between a man and a woman and centered around vaginal penetration. \u00a0I was 16 before I realized that there was an option other than heterosexual\u2013talk about sheltered. Even though there must be other definitions, I can't stop thinking of a virgin as someone who has never had a penis in their vagina (or of course put their penis in someone\u2019s vagina).<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story:</strong><br />\n<br />\nI never intended to stay a virgin for so long. \u00a0There was no decision, no religious grounds, no anything else; in some ways it would be easier if there was/had been. I've been 'large' for most of my life and it's taken me a long time to feel OK with that. \u00a0I never understood why someone would find me attractive, so when asked on a date I would assume they were desperate, dared or insane, none of which appealed to me so I would always say no. In a way, I stayed a virgin only because I never let anyone close enough to form a relationship where I'd want to have sex with them.<br />\n<br />\nI didn't really think about my virginity one way another until about 24 when almost overnight I developed this feeling that I had 'missed the boat.'\u00a0 Suddenly it went from something I didn't even think about to a source of shame. \u00a0I always thought 'how do you explain to someone that you want to wait longer because it's your first time?' Most of my friends thought nothing of casual sex, and I felt so different to them. In the end I decided that I didn't care; I wasn't going to let being a virgin define who I am or how I live my life. \u00a0But at 30 (almost 31) everyone around me is getting married and/or having children and I've still never had sex. \u00a0In a lot of ways I just want it done, I wish I'd just had a one night stand years ago.<br />\n<br />\nSo I decided I needed a plan, I'm NOT making it to 31!\u00a0 I've been trying everything from dating sites to 'adult-dating' sites. It hasn't been working so I'm hiring an escort for a night. \u00a0I haven't chosen one yet, still trawling through the hundreds of them out there, my cut off for deciding is the end of September.<br />\n<br />\nSome will criticize, but I'm comfortable with this choice.

I'm in my junior year at Hobart and William Smith Colleges studying Social Justice, with minors in Theater and Latin American Studies.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong><br />\n<br />\nHow I define virginity has changed for me so much to the point that I feel I've 'lost' my virginity multiple times, but still have things I have never experienced thus I am a 'virgin' for. I understand the medical idea of virginity, breaking of the hymen and so forth, but by that notion I may have lost my virginity the first time I used a tampon which was years before I had actual 'sex\u2019 is just kind of silly to me. I consider intercourse to be breaking the virginity seal (hymen), but I know that sex and physical relations come in many forms, not all that require or include penetration, but that, at least under my definition, makes people no longer virgins. Virginity for me is about growing up. It's stepping over a threshold from innocence into adulthood, and sex is a large part of what our culture thinks makes us adults. I don't think that the loss of your virginity automatically makes you an adult, it's simply one thing in a series of events that allows you to view yourself in a different light.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story: </strong><br />\n<br />\nWell first off let me say that I was desperate, absolutely desperate to lose my virginity. I thought that it had taken longer than average for me to have my first kiss, first date etc. and as I thought I was behind the curve, I wanted to get it over and done with. I thought about sex constantly (gotta love those teenage hormones) and thought that losing my virginity would be like a magical on/off switch that would cure my self-esteem problems and worries about the fact that I didn't have a 'real' boyfriend. I always had a number of friends who were older than me, I had gotten my first kiss from someone 10 years older than me, and in my 17 year old naivete I thought that being considered 'one of the team' made me as mature as 'the rest of the team.'<br />\n<br />\nOne night in October, I was hanging out at one of these older friends houses, with a few of his friends who I knew fairly well. We were smoking weed, watching TV, drinking a few beers; not doing anything particularly important. I'd been flirting with this one guy all night, and at some point we found ourselves alone in the room. Everyone else had gone to sleep, or smoke, or passed out, I'm not even sure. We started making out, and then he went down on me. Now understand this, I had only been kissed a handful of times and groped maybe once, but that was it. I had virtually no experience and a lot of pent up sexual frustration. So having a guy go down on me for the first time was beyond amazing. I'd never had an orgasm before, had read about them of course, but hadn't really been able to imagine what it would actually feel like. It felt fucking amazing.<br />\n<br />\nI kept asking him to have sex with me, (thinking that while this was unbelievably good, it wasn't actual sex like I'd been thinking about it). He kept deferring, he knew I was a virgin and didn't want to be the one to lead me into my sexual life. He made me come multiple times between the weed and the late night, and first time having anything down there, it just stands out in my mind as a huge block of time of indescribable pleasure. I kept begging and pleading and finally we did it. Or rather he did, I didn't do all that much, since I wasn't sure what I was supposed to be doing, and was too nervous about doing something wrong. It was kind of a let down. I mean I felt it, but it didn't feel amazing like the oral sex had, it just felt kind of strange. And then it was over.<br />\n<br />\nFor a few weeks after that I felt horribly racked with guilt that I didn't feel guilty. I mean I lost my virginity to a friend of a friend on the first friends couch; both of whom were older than me, I was stoned, a little tipsy, and you know what? I didn't care at all. I still don't. I lost my virginity on my own terms, when I wanted to. I wasn't forced or tricked into it, even if others think I was. I wasn't hurt, I was careful, didn't get sick or pregnant. It was simply over. The amount of relief I felt at just having done it was overwhelming.<br />\n<br />\nI've had enough sex since, to know and respect the difference between sex just for the sake of sex with someone you don't know well or at all, and sex with someone you like or love. Sex with someone you care deeply about is extremely special, beautiful even in how it makes you feel. But, at least for me, your first time doesn't have to be this magical expression of love. Losing your virginity is awkward, it feels strange, you don't know if you're doing anything right, or even if you're doing it wrong. I feel lucky that I lost it with someone who knew what they were doing, even if they didn't know me. My society tells me I should feel guilty for how I lost it, but I don't.

I\u2019ve found that as I've aged, I\u2019ve tended to lose a fair bit of my inhibition, and have to be careful of (at times) what I say. \u00a0I recently came to the conclusion that if an average 14-year-old male came to me and told me he\u2019d had a vision that he would remain a virgin until he was 50, I\u2019d say to him \"Have you thought of jumping in front of a fast-moving car?\" For someone like myself, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth going through the hell of sexual frustration: I\u2019ve been there too long. \u00a0After ending 10 years of chronic anxiety, my libido increased about 8 months ago, and I had to go through it again.<br />\n<br />\nWhen I was about 16, I fell in love with a fellow (female) student at school. \u00a0It was a typical country romance \u2013 I\u2019d known her for about 5 years, and we\u2019d grown up together. But even though she knew I loved her, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to tell her; I was too shy, and under a heavy dose of testosterone. She approached me three times, but was never proactive about it and after this, she gave up. \u00a0There was no one else, just her. \u00a0I never went to dances\u2013don\u2019t like them, and never drank alcohol, so I couldn\u2019t rely on this to lower my inhibitions and increase my confidence. \u00a0I just didn\u2019t know what to say to her. \u00a0I got to know two other females in the next 7 years or so who I took an interest in and told, but they put me straight into the \"friend zone.\" End of story.<br />\n<br />\nIn 1986, I moved from country Australia to the main state city due to a life crisis that would last for more than 20 years. I\u2019d been told by a number of supposedly \"wise\" people that this would be the best thing to do, and that I\u2019d be \"forced\" to make new friendships etc. As I\u2019d intuitively felt, it never worked that way. \u00a0I consequently became socially isolated, and never really made any friends; picking up females in bars was out of the question. \u00a0In 1985, I saw a psychiatrist to obtain advice prior to moving down to the city. \u00a0When I asked her advice on trying to get a girlfriend, she made a face and changed the subject immediately.<br />\n<br />\nIn 1990, in the city, I sought counseling from a very nice lady who worked for the local council to try to help with my adjustment problems in the city. \u00a0When I asked her the same question, she said \"You don\u2019t need to to have a sexual relationship.\" I told her I just wanted a girlfriend, and all she could suggest was that it was easy to meet people by walking dogs in the park.<br />\n<br />\nFeminism has apparently taught females to \"have sex like a man,\" but many don\u2019t seem to realize what they\u2019re missing out on by approaching quiet males and building up their confidence. \u00a0I suggest reading JM Kearn\u2019s 2008 classic \"Why Mr Right Can\u2019t Find You.\" I think it explains a great deal.<br />\n<br />\nUntil the internet came online, there was, it seems, very little worthwhile information on relationship development. \u00a0I still see couples of all ages, and keep thinking \"How did they do that?\" (form a relationship).", "tags": [21, 147, 101, 69, 39, 26, 40, 32, 18, 33, 45, 31, 34, 9, 6, 8, 24, 3, 23, 66, 1], "maxage": 57, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2012/10/first-person-david-i-got-to-know-other-females-but-they-put-me-straight-into-the-friend-zone/", "date": "2012-10-16", "definition": "", "aboutyou": "I'm male, 57-years-old, from South Melbourne, Australia."}}, {"pk": 129, "model": "firstperson.story", "fields": {"firstgraf": "Our latest First Person comes from YesIAm24 in\u00a0 New Orleans .

Honestly, I view virginity as a way to make people feel awful about a wonderful way as a way to \"protect\" them from ruining something amazing. But really this is something everyone should be free to explore without guilt. Your first time most likely won't be your last time. It certainly shouldn't be anyway.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story:</strong><br />\n<br />\nFor years, I was scared out of my mind about SEX. Not just scared but down right phobic. My friends found it to be a joke and would tease me endlessly about my fear. I would literally run screaming from the room when my mom would try to talk to me about SEX. Thankfully, I found this amazing guy who was extremely understanding and patient.<br />\n<br />\nPersonally, personal touch and time is very important to me and since SEX had been made into such a big deal in my life by religious beliefs and teachings and such I didn't know what to do. I knew it had to happen sometime, I couldn't get married without it but I was terrified I wouldn't like it or that it wouldn't work then there would be this horridly awful thing to deal with a person you JUST made a huge life commitment to. Plus everyone would know. That freaked me out the most, that everyone would KNOW about the SEX.<br />\n<br />\nAnyway, this amazing man talked with me about it even before we dated. We could talk about anything. He pursued me for five months while I was traveling the southern region of the US. Then we started being committed only to each other. And I realized I actually wanted to have sex with him. I didn't even want to have sex with the guy I was in love with for 8 years *gag* I have never really wanted to have sex with just ANYONE, but I knew I wanted to share it with HIM. He is the one I wanted to share my first time with even if we don't end up together forever. If anyone is \"worthy\", this one certainly is for various reasons. He was so considerate and sweet, checking up on me in case I was freaking out inside, but I wasn't. I actually didn't freak out at all. This was supposed to happen and I was so happy. His penis was inside my vagina and I didn't start instantly burning (as in hellfire and brimstone, thank God either way). I did not lose anything. I gained my womanhood.<br />\n<br />\nFinally, I do not have to hide behind not knowing or being \"innocent\" which really means \"reason for others to feel superior.\" I can't wait to move home and be a woman more often.

My best friend helped to enlighten me, as well as made me feel more comfortable with the idea of sex. That was around the time I was in 10th grade.

I am a female and I live in Arizona.\r\n\r\n<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>\r\n\r\nTo be a virgin doesn't mean you're pure. Girls think its okay to give blowjobs and make out with everyone they now and still be considered pure. Your virginity is just a weird thing that people took and reformatted the meaning. Being a virgin just means you haven't had penetrative sex.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tell us your story</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen I was 15 I had known this guy for about 6 years. I always thought he was so hot and he NEVER liked me back until I was 15. I had gotten my braces off, grown out my hair and got curves; too bad I moved off to another city in Arizona huh? Well I would go back down and visit a lot and we started, yah know, \"talking.\" So we were planning on having sex and him taking my virginity. I was super insecure of my body so I was anxious about it. But the night it had came down to it..I was fine. It was uncomfortable though and the guy honestly didn't care. He turned me around at like 4am to do it AGAIN and I did.\r\n\r\nSo the day after I was all excited and stuff and wanted to do it again but when I got home and after a few weeks I realized what a huge mistake I made. I literally feel like throwing up thinking about it and how gross it was seeing him make weird noises and talk dirty which I hated. I often get random glimpses of thoughts of the actual sex. I hate him so much now the thought of him grosses me out and I'm never comfortable around guys now.\r\n\r\nI am emotionally scared. I literally hate him so much I hope he dies. Just talking about it makes me want to throw up and die myself. I clearly wasn't ready. DON'T LET GUYS PRESSURE YOU TO HAVE SEX.

I work in the technical support group of a huge computer software company. I've been married twice, divorced since 1992, and have been in relationship with another twice-divorced woman my age since early 2005.\r\n\r\n<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>\r\n\r\nI really have no clue. I think it's a social construct whose definition varies among people and over time. Personally I stopped feeling like a virgin after the first time I had penis-in-vagina sex. But I wouldn't presume to have an opinion on when a lesbian should no longer identify as virgin.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tell us your story</strong>\r\n\r\nI started masturbating at age 12, had my first date at 13, and in spite of lots of making out in high school and my first year and a half of college, didn't have penis-in-vagina intercourse until age 20. My mother's last words to me when I walked out the door to go to college were, \"Remember, Dan, gentlemen don't take virgins.\" That was all either parent ever said to me on the topic of sex.\r\n\r\nWhen The Big Event finally happened, it was a disaster. I had been dating Hellen for months and my mind was overwhelmed with the thought, \"She's letting me do it!\" I couldn't get an erection to save my soul. After some time passed, I was finally able to complete intercourse. but I was so self-involved the whole time, I wouldn't blame Hellen a bit if she felt completely disconnected from me through the whole experience. Our relationship lasted only another year and a half.\r\n\r\nI met another girl early in my senior year with whom I thought I fell in love, and she agreed to marry me. She wanted to be a virgin on her wedding night, and I reluctantly resolved not to pressure her about it. I was woefully inexperienced, and she had no experience at all, so after our first intercourse in our honeymoon hotel, she told me, \"If I had know that that's all it was going to be, I wouldn't have waited.\" From that day forward I never once felt like an adequate lover for her. The marriage barely lasted five years.\r\n\r\nAnother dear friend from high school kept herself virginal and walked down the aisle with her high school sweetheart as pure as the driven snow, but discovered after the wedding that he was actually gay, a fact that might have come to light if she had been open to a test drive.\r\n\r\nThese experiences have naturally led me to the conclusion that marrying as a virgin is a bad idea. Your mileage may vary, of course. Mostly, I am deeply saddened by our culture's active hostility toward any semblance of reason and respect for nature when it comes to every single aspect of human sexuality.", "tags": [121, 44, 126, 78, 15, 107, 84, 26, 105, 9, 113, 88, 7, 24, 56, 23, 2, 1, 139], "maxage": 63, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2013/01/first-person-dan-my-mothers-last-words-to-me-when-i-went-to-college-were-remember-dan-gentlemen-dont-take-virgins/", "date": "2013-01-22", "definition": "it\u2019s a social construct whose definition varies among people and over time", "aboutyou": "I'm 63, male, living in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Obviously, I can\u2019t be all of these things... but just as obviously, the wide variety of people and institutions I interact with throughout my day-to-day life are defining these terms very differently than I do. So let me be more clear, and maybe help you clear up some of your own confusion about what labels you \"have to\" use, and what labels you want to proudly claim for your own.<br />\n<br />\nAbout four and a half years ago, my girlfriend Katie and I had what we would have called our \"first time.\" Since we\u2019re both women, we don\u2019t have the ease of understanding or assuming what \"losing your virginity\" is that someone paired with another person of a different gender might have. After a lot of conversations, we came to the decision that we didn\u2019t want to be completely naked together until we had a room where we had a right to close and lock the door without anyone questioning us- in other words, until I could travel to her dorm room at her college rather than just seeing each other when we were both on break in our hometown. It was sweet, sometimes awkward, incredibly meaningful, and overall a wonderful \"first time.\"<br />\n<br />\nBut that\u2019s not the end of the story.<br />\n<br />\nOver the next several years of our relationship, we grew and changed in ways that humans tend to do. We decided that, honestly, anything we did together that caused orgasms really counted as sex, and so while we\u2019ll always love our \"first time,\" we\u2019d been having sex for quite a while before that.<br />\n<br />\nSimultaneously, we faced a world that doesn\u2019t really know what it thinks about lesbians and sex, other than that it\u2019s probably bad. I heard in so many ways how my relationship wasn\u2019t valid. I had a bulletin-board conversation with one of my floormates about how I couldn\u2019t really ever have sex, only \"sexual acts,\" since no penises were entering any vaginas. (This caused an awful lot of running jokes among my friends from that point on- \"Are you and Katie going to go have not-sex now? Did you have tons of wild, wild not-sex over your Valentine\u2019s Weekend trip?\")<br />\n<br />\nI even had a leader of a fairly nonconformative group on campus tell me to my face that, \"Of course I was still a virgin.\" As headstrong and self-confident as I tried to be, I couldn\u2019t shake a nagging feeling that maybe these people were onto something. Did this really not count?<br />\n<br />\nNearly three years after that first idea of a first time, I was still dating Katie and we\u2019d exchanged engagement rings. We\u2019d also been talking more and more about polyamory, and had finally taken the first nervous step of indicating our interest to another engaged couple in our social circle who were generally known to be open. That first poly relationship had more rules than I could shake a stick at- and a lot of them had to do with what we were calling sex, and how we felt about what we were doing. Yeah, we were all having sex, but only certain kinds with certain people at certain times- and it got even more complicated when I (confirmed, out-and-proud lesbian harboring confusing bisexual tendencies) was interacting in EXTREMELY AWKWARD ways with the male person in that couple. Emotional and intimate issues eventually led us to separate from them.<br />\n<br />\nSo now who was I? I\u2019d slept with two people besides my fiancee... sort of? But everyone consented, so it wasn\u2019t like I was a cheating hussy or anything. But I still liked girls better. Yeah. That\u2019s right.<br />\n<br />\nThen, of course, I had to go and fall in love with another man, and the tangle of that relationship could take a novel all of its own. I was head over heels for only the second time in my life, and I thought I\u2019d found the solution to my fears about sex with men: someone kind and gentle and ostensibly pure; a very Christian, definitely virgin, partner.<br />\n<br />\nSuffice to say, polyamory only works when everyone involved is honest not only with each other, but with themselves, and can clearly state their own needs and issues. He was dealing with a lot of shame and self-loathing about the concept of sex in general, and we spent several months in the surreal state where he insisted that we weren\u2019t having sex if it was just dry humping, and I assured him (not just quietly, but firmly, more than once) that it sure felt like sex to me. In the end, our differences tore us apart in a very messy way - I said unfortunate things in public, Katie cried (an occasion of once a decade or so), and this guy turned up what had previously been an annoying tendency to wheedle into full-out emotional manipulation and abuse. When he left, I told Katie that I was done with men. They just hurt me.<br />\n<br />\nBut here we are now. I\u2019m typing this letter to all of you sitting in bed next to Katie (who is now my wife, according to my church and everyone who matters), the smell of our boyfriend still clinging to the pillows, and I can see our girlfriend\u2019s hairbrush where she forgot it on the bookshelf. Turns out that while Katie and I were learning about maturity, heartbreak, and what a really bad relationship looks like, John and Emily, that first couple we were with, were learning their own lessons. Emily doesn\u2019t let her insecurity keep her from enjoying her bisexuality to the fullest. Katie is more willing to trust human beings in general. John is much more conscious about balancing his now-wife\u2019s needs with caring for the other women he loves. And I have finally gotten over my own guilt trip about loving men enough to finally REALLY enjoy sex with him.<br />\n<br />\nToday, I went to Planned Parenthood to get fitted for a diaphragm so I can feel as confident as possible about minimizing pregnancy risks before I do what a lot of people call losing my virginity.<br />\n<br />\nWhen I filled out my new client paperwork, I cringed as I marked my marital status as single, because according to the government, Katie doesn\u2019t count. When I added my emergency contact information, I proudly listed Katie\u2019s phone number, and noted under relationship the word Wife.<br />\n<br />\nFinally, I went into my appointment to get fitted for birth control. I was incredibly grateful that the clinic staff seemed entirely uninterested in questioning these discrepancies - I really didn\u2019t want any delays.<br />\n<br />\nI\u2019m planning to have intercourse for the first time as soon as we can manage a good stretch of time, because otherwise we might just pounce each other like animals in the middle of cooking each other a nice dinner some night this week. It\u2019s unbelievable how good and healing it feels to finally be having the kind of relationships I want, in the ways that I want, and for the most part on the terms that I want. I can\u2019t change the world, but I think I\u2019ve finally got a handle- at least for the moment- on how I see myself.<br />\n<br />\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is, whoever you are, whatever you are or aren\u2019t doing with whatever people of whatever gender in whatever numbers or combinations: it\u2019s okay.<br />\n<br />\nSeriously, it\u2019s okay. You can call yourself a virgin if that word has a lot of meaning for you, but don\u2019t let people use it like a measuring rod or a judgement from on high. You can call yourself a lesbian, bisexual, straight, ace, whatever; but don\u2019t let that stop you from admitting when you love someone, because you might just be missing out on some amazing experiences. You can build whatever relationship structures you like, as long as they\u2019re working for everyone involved. More important than definitions or rules is your own comfort, your own consent, and your own desire.<br />\n<br />\nSo go out there and love freely (and safely!), and be who you want to be. And only you get to decide whether or not you\u2019re a \"virgin.\"<br />\n<br />\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.scarleteen.com/article/words/like_a_virgin_what_having_sex_and_first_times_have_meant_to_me\" target=\"_blank\">This story</a> originally ran in Scarleteen in November, 2012.

I had my first boyfriend when I just turned 15, and we messed around a bit but never had actual sex.<br />\n<br />\nThroughout the rest of high school, I never felt attractive to the opposite sex, except for randomly making out with boys at dances and parties. I felt frustrated and isolated, even though almost everyone else at my high school was also a virgin. I almost believed that sex would never happen for me.<br />\n<br />\nI went off to college, and about two weeks into my freshman year, I got extremely drunk and high at a party and ended up hooking up with an older guy from another college in the back of his car. He called me for three days afterward to hang out, but I wasn't sure how I felt about the whole situation, having gone for so long without having sex, so I ended up ignoring him and never saw him again.<br />\n<br />\nI was angry at myself for not waiting out for someone more meaningful, but then all my college friends started losing their virginity in a similar fashion, and I learned to embrace my sexuality.

I am currently in my senior year of college, and superbly confused about how to do what I want with my life. I grew up the daughter of a Southern Baptist pastor (yeah, I know I should be Catholic) and I currently attend a nondenominational church where I have strengthened my faith in God, and simultaneously lowered my moral standards. Contradictory eh?<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How do you define virginity?\u2028\u2028</span><br />\nI guess for most people that would be vaginal sex. If I was normal, I think that would be my answer anyway. The way I define my virginity is by who I want to remember having sex with for the first time. Therefore, I have decided that I am a virgin.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Why did you decide to stay a virgin?\u2028\u2028</span><br />\nI guess in the technical sense of the word, I\u2019m not one. I was molested when I was 12 and 13 by a man who was like my grandfather. I was obviously terrified of the whole experience, and while I knew what he was doing to me was wrong, I didn\u2019t know what to do or how to tell. Everything sort of escalated to the night he raped me, and that was my breaking point. I broke down and told my mom, yet I have never ever told anyone that I was raped, not until now anyways. I was so ashamed that I allowed it to continue, even though I was of an age that I should have known better. I obviously don\u2019t blame myself now, but I did then. After that I went on a downward spiral of alcohol and oral sex with older boys until I was about 16.<br />\n<br />\nI obviously was raised pretty conservatively, and so I made a True Love Waits commitment when I was 16, and I sort of straightened myself out. I really stuck to my commitment until recently, as I realized that at 21, I have no intentions of getting married anytime soon, and I simply don\u2019t think I can wait that long to have sex. I\u2019ve sort of come to the conclusion that I\u2019ll have sex when I want to. I\u2019m not sure I believe in all this \"the right person\" business, but I just think that if I\u2019ve been dating someone and I want to, I will. The last few guys I\u2019ve dated weren\u2019t the greatest, and I couldn\u2019t imagine myself having sex with them. (No joke, the last one had the most obnoxious country accent ever. The way he said my name made me wince.)<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How have your partners reacted?\u2028\u2028</span><br />\nWell, the only guy I ever tried to have sex with was when I was 15, pre-True Love Waits commitment. He was 19 and quite possibly the hottest guy I\u2019ve ever dated or come close to dating. Our relationship lasted about 5 months, and we did every sort of sexual activity imaginable until it built up to actual sex. I thought I was ready, but once I was down to my underwear I just started crying uncontrollably. I was so upset with myself, but he was really nice about it. He held me until I stopped crying and I think he sort of guessed what had happened although he never said anything. We broke up after that, not because I didn\u2019t have sex with him, but because I was sort of embarrassed not only about what happened, but that he also knew my secret essentially.<br />\n<br />\nThe other guys I dated were post-True Love Waits, and so I purposefully chose guys who had made the same commitment, so it wouldn\u2019t be so awkward. Not until college did I date another non-Christian boy, and so it was a little awkward having to bring it up. Most guys didn\u2019t seem to care as they were fairly inexperienced as well. Only one guy seemed surprised, mostly because we had engaged in oral sex (a LOT of oral sex) before we even started dating. He figured I was waiting to have sex until we became official, not until I was married.<br />\n<br />\nThe next partner I have I would like to not really say anything. I feel like I\u2019m lying a little bit, and unless we actually get to the sex part I don\u2019t think its really all that necessary.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Any general thoughts on virginity in our society?\u2028\u2028</span><br />\nI feel like virginity is so overemphasized in Christianity that it\u2019s annoying. Who really thinks that in an age where people are getting married later, and later that anyone will actually wait until they\u2019re 25, 35, 40? That is just unfair and biologically contradicting. If I was getting married now it would be no problem, but I can\u2019t see myself turning 22 without giving in to temptation. I\u2019m over the religious guilt because it\u2019s not realistic.<br />\n<br />\nOverall in society I think virginity isn\u2019t seen as a good thing. For the most part I was the odd one out of having sex. Out of my 6 closest friends, only 2 have not had sex and its only because they have never had the opportunity. (Neither one has had a boyfriend.) I think we should as a society teach how to make the best decision for yourself, not an end all be all for everyone.

And, well... let's just say that at this point in my life, I still haven't found that \"special someone\" yet. Corny? Maybe.<br /><br />But I look around at my \"peers\" in my age bracket who, by now, have gone through one or two or more marriages and well... Just what exactly did I \"miss\"? During the wild 80s and 90s, there was too much emphasis with sex (Get it as soon as and as often as you can and damn the consequences!) and not so much on the \"relationship\" side of things.<br /><br />Which leads me to wonder...

I know women who have and are still virgins, but they have those strong religious ties. I don't really have those reasons anymore (I did when I was teen, and I signed this stupid card that said I would only kiss boys \"lightly\" whatever that means. Oh, and sex was out of the question).<br />\n<br />\nSince I've figured out that I'm bi. I would love to have sex with someone I actually like, no matter the gender.<br />\n<br />\nBut I'm still a virgin because I'm really shy, really scared, and I have a hard time getting close to people physically, not even on a sexual level. Also, I've always been focused on what I've been doing right now, not on relationships. (True story: Broke up with my first boyfriend because he'd rather snuggle than let me do homework.)<br />\n<br />\nIt's weird, but you get to the point to where you lie about sex for your friends or smile and nod at their stories, like you know where their coming from (no pun intended) when you have no idea what's its like.

I like any type of art, I spend a lot of time online, I can't wait to go to college, and I'm involved in my Unitarian <span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_2\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Universalist</span> church's youth group.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">What is your definition of virginity?</span><br />\nI'm not really sure at this point, because I haven't had a reason to think about it. I've never even been kissed or been in a relationship. I imagine that my first sexual experience will be with a woman, so \"virginity\" could mean a variety of acts. To me, the meaningful part is the intimacy. I'd also consider non-penetrative sex with a man to constitute the end of my virginity... as long as it's good!<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Why have you decided to stay a virgin?</span><br />\nThe short answer is that hasn't been a decision. Some of the circumstances that led to it were choices\u2013I focus on my schoolwork, <span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_3\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">et</span> <span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_4\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">cetera</span>\u2013but I also am not really considered a sexy person by most people in my area and age group. I don't shave my legs because it's a stupid thing to do, and I give myself a haircut with my dad's electric razor, most recently with a 13mm blade. I wear cute dresses because I like them; but someone like me living around here, especially if I hate parties, isn't going to get a lot of people checking her out.<br />\n<br />\nAnother thing is that lot of my social activities either revolve around the church or around school. Unitarian Universalism is a religion that encourages a lot of openness about love and sex \u2013I mean a lot; participating in our Our Whole Lives sex ed program was a life-changing experience for me, though I didn't know it at the time\u2013but that doesn't mean that it's the best place to meet someone. I'm worried that I have some kind of undiagnosed social anxiety disorder that has kept me totally without relationship experience, although it's probably not true.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How have your dates/partners reacted?</span><br />\nI don't date. Again, it's not my intention not to date; I don't have the confidence yet to be the pursuer in a relationship, and the only people who've asked me out have been people I couldn't possibly imagine a relationship with, like people who were vastly overestimating the idea that we were even friends.<br />\n<br />\nI realized I was bisexual because I had a crush on a friend I thought was straight, who later came out to me as bisexual. But she moved away, and I couldn't communicate how much I liked her before she left. I think I actually said it once, but she didn't know I meant it. But who cares about her? That was so long ago. I actually just met a cute bi girl who is so, so fun to talk to, but I know that I don't have the self-confidence to ask her out. Since I missed the experimentation phase because the stupid people I share a town with don't hang out with <span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_5\" class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">dykey</span>-looking girls, I don't even know how to ask someone out. What do you say? What do you ask to do? I just don't have any ideas.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Any special plans or ideas for losing it?</span><br />\nI want my first time to be with another girl. I just feel like it'll be more intimate. This makes me not a true bisexual, I guess. I mean, I'd consider it with the right guy, but I just imagine it with a girl. And why not? I'm the one who gets to pick!<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Anything else you want to say about virginity?</span><br />\nI know I'm a bit young for it to be unusual that I'm a virgin, but I really wouldn't be surprised, if this blog is still going when I'm 22 or 25, if I'm not still a virgin then. Plus most people at 17 at least have been kissed, made out or whatever. I'm not a prude at all - I don't think! - but my life is complicated.

It\u2019s helpful to think of it as a sexual orientation, the natural other category with hetero-, homo- and bi-sexual.<br />\n<br />\nI was asked to do a First Person post what now seems like a very long time ago. I thought that inspiration would come easily, that I had a lot to say on the topic. I\u2019ve failed many times in writing this, and I now realise that I\u2019ve got nothing.<br />\n<br />\nSome asexuals deny the existence of an asexual virgin. The idea is that a virgin is someone waiting to have sex, defined by the fact that they haven\u2019t had sex YET. And asexuals aren\u2019t people who haven\u2019t had sex yet-they\u2019re people who aren\u2019t going to have sex at all.<br />\n<br />\nI\u2019m not too sure about this definition myself; personally, I think I\u2019m fully capable of having and enjoying sex, and vaguely plan to get round to it sometime in the future. Maybe. But the asexual community tends to give people like me space to decide that the virgin label really doesn\u2019t matter.<br />\n<br />\nSo I sat down to write a detailed description of how the idea of virginity impacts me, and I realised it doesn\u2019t, really. Sure, I can talk about the virginity paradigm in an abstracted sociological sense, but this blog already does that. Getting into my personal feelings on virginity was difficult. Ironically, given that I\u2019ve already been through this when discovering my sexuality, I was failing to notice an absence of feelings.<br />\n<br />\nI tend to disrupt virgin stereotypes; I happily play the \u2018dirty-minded asexual\u2019, comfortable with innuendos and sexuality. At this stage in my life, it\u2019s not too surprising that I\u2019m a virgin, as I grow older (if I remain a virgin), I think people won\u2019t notice. So maybe the asexual exemption clause applies to me, too, I\u2019m not stuck at a stage in the system- I\u2019m outside the system. Not because I will never have sex, but because I don\u2019t believe that my sexual history is a reflection of where I am as a sexual being.<br />\n<br />\nAsexuality is quite introspective, and for me particularly, my sexuality is based more on what goes on inside my head than in my (non-existent) love life. I think I've escaped the need to validate my sexuality with what I do or don't do, it's just about what I feel or don't feel. I don\u2019t believe (although I can\u2019t be certain) that I will change after having sex, that I will feel fundamentally on new ground.", "tags": [30, 84, 10, 95, 11, 12, 104, 103, 24, 3, 23, 66, 1, 102], "maxage": 19, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2010/07/first-person-smsome-asexuals-deny-the-existence-of-an-asexual-virgin/", "date": "2010-07-05", "definition": "the label really doesn\u2019t matter", "aboutyou": ""}}, {"pk": 9, "model": "firstperson.story", "fields": {"firstgraf": "This week's First Person interview comes from 19-year-old Reva who writes a blog called Girl Who Got Bored in Canada.

I have never had a serious relationship in my life and I am a virgin.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How do you define virginity?</span><br />One can technically define virginity as a not having had sexual intercourse, but I don't see either the state of being virginal or non-virginal as having some characteristics intrinsically associated with it.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Why have you decided to stay a virgin?</span><br />I could ponder over many of the psychosocial reasons for this state, but at the end of the day, it doesn't really differentiate me from the biggest sluts or studs as a person. I don't really think much about my virginity to be honest, because I don't think having sex will change me as a person. I think we are past the day and age when losing one's virginity was a rite of passage. With the information age, and the increasingly greater emphasis on the individual, I feel like virginity or the loss of it is an invalid concern to understand a person.<br /><br />I guess I should provide some context as to how I was raised to think about virginity. My parents, being moderately liberal Indians, weren't big on arranged marriages or religion, however, they told me to be consistently \"careful\" with matters of the heart or the body. I don't know what they meant by it, but they insisted that I didn't do things that would make me \"sick\". This made me a big prude for a few of my teenage years. Later, I cast off that prudishness, and became way more open-minded and accepting of my own sexuality. That helped me become a more easy-going person.<br /><br />In my social circle, I'm quite open about my sexual thoughts and desires, as are most of the virgins who I hang out with. A lot of us have been career-minded freaks with no patience for womanly ways or charms, we have turned into this group of overgrown tomboys who are sometimes really horny. We talk about it. We talk about our masturbation habits. We seldom feel like we are missing out on much because we aren't getting laid. Mind you, we are probably an unfortunate bunch of outliers. I guess intimate romantic relationships haven't been near the top on our list of priorities.<br /><br />I have a lot of male friends who I am equally open with. Many will say that I don't really feel romantic feelings so much, because I have never been treated like a woman by a man. I don't expect to, or want to be treated according to my gender. The few serious romantic feelings I have had in my life towards men are rooted in an intellectual attraction. I've been intellectually whore-<span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_1\">ish</span> as long as I can remember, and it seems it's probably gonna be the only way I would ideally like to get physically laid in.<br /><br />Since I was a child, as I have written in my blog recently, I romanticized the idea of a single life with other single people. While I no longer fantasize about living in a convent, I admire the bachelor lifestyle that a lot of college students live. It will get old one day, for sure, but I enjoy how it helps me grow as a person. I feel a bond with every person I have shared living space with, gotten drunk with or had an intellectual debate with. Being with someone will probably take away how much I cherish each and every individual so much, and I am sort of afraid for that.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Any special plans or ideas for losing it?</span><br />I do yearn to be in a relationship. Sex can come in the context of it. I am not the one for random one night stands, unless it involves massive instant attraction of intellect and some sort of pseudo-spiritual connection. I am still unsure. I don't have many regrets about what I have been through so far. Despite having no luck whatsoever in love, I feel confident and positive about myself. I don't hold back and I am usually easy to get along with. For now, that is enough for me.", "tags": [52, 13, 11, 51, 34, 8, 50, 6, 47, 5, 1], "maxage": 19, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2009/07/first-person-revaim-quite-open-about-my-sexual-thoughts-and-desires/", "date": "2009-07-27", "definition": "", "aboutyou": "I am a 19-year-old university student.

I grew up in a liberal household, with an ex-hippie, onetime sex educator, feminist mom. No religious or social taboos about sex to be found. The general attitude about sex was just: be safe and do it with someone you care about.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">What is your definition of virginity?</span><br />\nThis is a complicated question, because for people of different orientations, with different options for sex, it means different things. For me, as a heterosexual female, it's penetration. I think that oral sex is still \"sex,\" but especially as a woman with the potential first-time pain that comes along with vaginal intercourse, the sort of trust that requires, virginity is for me about intercourse.<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><br />\nWhy did you decide to stay a virgin?</span><br />\nIt's funny - my first response is \"Oh, no, it was not my choice!\" I never wanted to be a virgin through my mid-twenties. I did have chances to have sex in college and after that I didn't go for because I wasn't ready, either for sex in general or sex with that person. For a long while I wanted to lose my virginity in the context of a serious, committed relationship and I have dated people, but nothing serious or long-term. At some point I decided I didn't need a boyfriend to lose my virginity, but it still took a while to find the right person and situation. (I think actually finding the right person outside of that framework - as in, not my boyfriend - may have been what changed my mind about that.)<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">When did you lose your virginity?<br />\n</span>A few months ago, at the ripe old age of 26 I spent a night with a guy I'd <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">briefly</span> dated a couple of years ago. Just after we'd gone out on a couple of dates, he'd moved to another town, but now almost two years later, he was here for a weekend for work. I still felt very comfortable with him, loved spending time with him, and trusted him. We didn't have intercourse, but we went farther than I'd gone sexually before. He said something about \"You should come visit me in my town,\" and sure enough, my job took me there for a weekend a few months later. We agreed I'd stay at his place. I was nervous and also somewhat on a mission.<br />\n<br />\nI got a lot of good, thoughtful advice from <a href=\"http://www.scarleteen.com/\">Scarleteen.</a> Although I'm about ten years out of their target demographic, it was really helpful to read other people's experiences of losing their virginity. I don't talk about sex much with my friends, and definitely not about my insecurities about being a virgin in my mid-twenties. Hearing from women who ended up waiting and were totally fine\u2013socially-adjusted, sexy, smart\u2013was great. One thing I read was that you should tell your partner that you're a virgin in the interest of openness. If it's your first time, you want the guy to be a little more... gentle than he might otherwise be. So I decided he needed to know.<br />\n<br />\nOn my second night with this guy, in the middle of fooling around, I told him. Or rather, I stopped what we were doing, and sat there for about five minutes trying to get the words out of my mouth. I really hate the the phrase \"I'm a virgin\"\u2013it makes it seem like virginity is your defining characteristic. I'm a person who happens to not have had sex. I finally got the words out (I think it was \"I haven't had sex before\") and we talked a lot about it. He was a remarkably sweet, open, communicative person\u2013my instinct that I could trust him was right. And then, well, you get the idea.<br />\n<br />\nHe was concerned that it wouldn't be good for me to lose my virginity to someone I wouldn't get to see or date, that it would set me up to be hurt. But the fact is, and I told him this, a boyfriend who lives in your town can hurt you, too, and this way I knew what to expect - that I would get on that plane at the end of the weekend and go. It didn't have to be a bigger deal than that. Do I sometimes now feel really, really sad that we don't live in the same town? Yes. Would I miss him less if we hadn't had intercourse? No. The intimacy was already there. This was just another aspect of it.<br />\n<br />\nI wondered if I'd feel different afterwards, like something major about me had changed, and for the most part I don't. Having sex was just another step along the gradual slope of sexual experience. This was just the one where you really ought to tell someone that what you're doing is new. I do feel freer now to pursue sex\u2013now that there's no big-deal disclosure necessary beforehand\u2013so I want to go out there, find people I like, and have sex with them and enjoy myself.

We'd love to run it in this blog!</span><br />\n<br />\nToday I was reading about stay-at-home daughters and Purity Balls. I thought, \"These people are nuts!\"<br />\n<br />\nBut when I said, as a teenager, \"I'm going to be a virgin until marriage,\" it put me in solidarity with these crazies.<br />\n<br />\nWhen I think back on why I chose virginity in adolescence, though, I realize that despite being connected with these loons, I wasn't exactly like them. Firstly, I was able to choose it. Stay-at-home daughters don't choose their destiny or how to explore their sexuality. They go straight from home to husband, with no time on their own to even think about getting their cherries popped.<br />\n<br />\nI thought about conversations I had with my mother. Of course, she encouraged me to wait until marriage (she only had one partner before my father, her husband), but she still said, \"If you do have sex before marriage, use protection!\" So there was never pressure from my mom to stay a virgin \"or else.\" It wasn't so much about being pure because God says that's what purity is (even though that became part of it for me). It was more about protection of my body, heart and soul. Protection of the body from pregnancy and STDs, protection of the heart and soul from the heartbreak of breaking up with someone to whom you lost your virginity. Meanwhile, my dad said, \"No dating until you're 16!\" I was a little too obedient to that! But he said it was because teenage boys were immature and only interested in sex. I went to an all-girls high school so I don't know if that was true for every teenage boy, but the junior high boys sure seemed that way...<br />\n<br />\nI think there's a difference between telling your daughter to be a virgin to please God and telling your daughter to be a virgin to protect herself. I guess both can be problematic, but at least in the latter it's more about your daughter, not rules. My parents taught me that I shouldn't give it up to a guy that didn't deserve me. My mom told me over and over, \"your body is a temple, and was only designed for a king.\" That statement can be problematic too. I think my body is not just designed for a man's pleasure. But again, that statement is taken out of the context of a discussion of how wonderful a person I am, how precious my body is, and how I shouldn't just throw it around at any guy who flirts with me.<br />\n<br />\nAnd I never thought for a second that abstinence-only education should be taught in public schools! I went to public schools through junior high. In the late 90's, we learned about abstinence and contraception. I liked that the best protection against pregnancy and STDs was just to not have sex. Obvious, straightforward, and you don't have to worry about taking pills or fiddling with condoms or getting tested...protected sex seemed like such a hassle. Get to the fun already!<br />\n<br />\nAgain, my stance is in transition. I don't want to have an oppressive definition of femininity or female sexuality. As a teenager, I didn't feel like I was missing out or that virginity was holding me back from living a full life. My early twenties were quite full and amazing, even without a boyfriend!<br />\n<br />\nBut now I do feel like I'm missing out. Now, I feel it's a lie to say being a virgin is still liberating or empowering me, helping me live a full life. Now, something's missing...<br />\n<br />\nAnd I definitely don't want to be mistaken for the SAHD's or Purity Ball people! But if people still talk to me like someone who's had sex, I guess I'm not as loony as the fundamentalists.", "tags": [15, 38, 28, 90, 9, 10, 11, 31, 6, 5, 89, 3, 1], "maxage": 39, "link": "http://www.virginitymovie.com/2011/02/first-person-repost-why-choose-virginity/", "date": "2010-02-09", "definition": "protection of body, heart and soul", "aboutyou": ""}}, {"pk": 72, "model": "firstperson.story", "fields": {"firstgraf": "Our latest First Person comes from Courtney from Missouri who talks about why, when it comes to sex, women can't\u00a0 win.

I have a Bachelor's Degree and work full time. I enjoy reading, music, history, fashion, lattes, learning new things and going to indie films\u2013among other things.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong><br />\n<br />\nNever having sexual intercourse. I'm on the fence about oral sex.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story</strong><br />\n<br />\nI never thought that I would be a 30-year-old virgin who has never had a boyfriend or even full on made out with a guy. I always thought things like that would \"just happen\" whenever I would have my first serious relationship. I thought maybe in college or through work or through 'mutual friends.' Well, that never happened.<br />\n<br />\nI see it as a combination of my personality (quiet/introvert/non-flirtatious) crossed with circumstance (work in industry with crazy hours and lived in places without a lot of single people around my age), crossed with possibly Western society focusing more on sex as opposed to relationships. Although I was never the hot chick in school or even the hot chick now, I put effort into my appearance so I can feel better about myself and maybe not look like someone as inexperienced as I am (if there is a look of inexperience that exists).<br />\n<br />\nAlthough I grew up Catholic, I wasn't one of those people that wanted to be married before having sex. I figured I was being realistic. A lot of people over a certain age are virgins for religious reasons, but not me. I can't get a first date, yet alone a boyfriend.

The old me would have said \"willie in hoo ha\", but the world is so big, full of so many different people living different lives and looking for different things out of their relationships and encounters with others that all these idiosyncrasies have me overwhelmed. So for now I will just say \"untouched\", which is what I consider myself to be.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Why have you chosen to remain a virgin?</strong><br />\n<br />\nI can only speculate that I don\u2019t want a sexual relationship with another person badly enough to pursue it. I mean if I was really eager I would have done it in my teens or at a \"normal age\" (as my peers often put it), when hormones were supposedly bouncing off their proverbial walls and horny teen-aged boys were hurling themselves at my feet. I dated a handful of people in college (albeit out of curiosity/intrigue), but the relationships never progressed to a level where I would feel comfortable enough to take that step. I actually didn\u2019t become interested in sex until I was in my 20s and began experimenting with masturbation. I can\u2019t express how great it felt to have learned about my body's' needs on my own, and expelling the \"christian guilt\" attached to that. I thought \"wow, I really don\u2019t need another person for this, do I?\"<br />\n<br />\nNow that I am not in an environment where I\u2019m meeting people organically, fostering the kinds of relationships I would consider ideal for pursuing intercourse has become more difficult. And to be perfectly frank, I\u2019m not really trying, which brings me back to my original sentiment: I don\u2019t believe I want a sexual relationship with a partner at this point in my life. If there was a person I was interested in romantically the circumstances would probably be different, but even then I would invest more time in nurturing the human connection, which I value very much, than getting laid.<br />\n<br />\nIf I was forced to choose between having sex for the first time or going skydiving (something I have wanted to do since I was 12) I would pick skydiving every time.

I'm studying engineering at university, with one year left of my bachelor's. I love snow, mangoes and having baking adventures with friends.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong><br />\n<br />\nIf you'd asked me that a year ago, I would have said that it's the state of having never experienced P-in-V. That's the standard definition, and I never really questioned it. But now I think that this is too simplistic. Not that it isn't a big deal. Particularly for me, as a girl, allowing somebody to go beyond touching the outside of my body and to actually enter *inside* my body is definitely significant. The inside of my head, of my heart, of my soul, and of my body, are very private places that belong only to me.<br />\n<br />\nBut virginity isn't a loss. It's part of a gradual gaining of experience that starts the first time you confide in someone, or kiss someone, or share something private. And with the right kind of experience comes wisdom and empowerment, not devaluing and loss.<br />\n<br />\n<strong> <strong>Tell us your story:</strong> </strong><br />\n<br />\nStrangely enough, the way it happened for me was exactly the way it's \"supposed\" to happen. Here I was, 22, having decided that I would only want to lose my virginity in the context of a committed, loving relationship (the modern version of \"not until marriage\"). I had totally swallowed the subliminal propaganda that girls shouldn't want sex or should at least try and hide it if they do, and thus had no knowledge of my own body or sexuality whatsoever. I was totally chaste and pure, or from another perspective, uneducated, uninformed, powerless and totally vulnerable to manipulation.<br />\n<br />\nBut I was lucky. I fell deeply in love and this love was returned. My partner and I have taken this whole journey of experience together, the first time for both of us. No pressure or expectations, just learning and loving and laughing. I'm learning about my body and my sexuality regrettably late, but I'm incredibly lucky to have experienced it in the best way possible for me.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?<br />\n</strong><br />\n<br />\nThe focus is just wrong. Let's place value on gaining experience in the right way, instead of placing stigma on losing innocence in the \"wrong\" way. Girls should never feel ashamed or ignorant about their bodies, or ashamed if they're *not* ignorant about their bodies. How many of you girls out there have actually looked at your own vulva in a mirror, or seen photos of a vulva? I sure hadn't, not until I was 23 and after I lost my virginity. Wrong order!! Boys also shouldn't feel pressure to be sexually experienced. It's totally okay to be at whatever stage you're at, whoever you are.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Want to tell your story?

I have had many thoughts run through my head about this as the years kept rolling by. What is wrong with me? Then, I actually started thinking that maybe I'm special in a way; a shy virgin.

Now, at 51, I'm still nervous and shy around women and if for some reason I was put into this position, I think it would be even more difficult now at my age to tell a woman I'm a virgin and that I would need her guidance and experience to teach me. I'm no movie star or model and women don't turn their heads to look at me, but when a woman would go to bed with me the nerves and shakes and total lack of experience would leave me failing again.<br />\n<br />\nI don't know if it sounds weird, but at my age now, living without sex, I kind of have a yearning that if I could lose my virginity even with a prostitute I would love to be taken by a strong lady.

To me, virginity is not something that is taken or lost--it is something added to the relationship between two people who care about each other and are aware of the emotionally components of sex.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story</strong><br />\n<br />\nI am a virgin and believe I will wait to have sex until the man who will be my husband makes his intentions clear. While religiously contemplative, my feelings stem from my relationship experience, too complex to recount here. I am looking forward to sex and took joy in sharing my sexuality\u2013though not sex\u2013with an ex-boyfriend, who also viewed sex as a commitment and bond to be shared with the person he would marry. For me, being a virgin is not the product of lack of sex life. It is the result of the relationships I have chosen and expectations within those relationships. I am seeking a relationship characterized by faithfulness, courage, constancy, respect, love, loyalty, and joy. If I accept anything less, including a casual approach to sex, it would be with the self-knowledge that I know what I need and want and settled for something much less, and I can think of no worse way for me to inflict emotional self-harm. Unfortunately, I sometimes feel...sorrow: I am ready to begin a life I cannot choose and that may not be in my future.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?</strong><br />\n<br />\nI think our society has taken the joy out of sex by seeking to erase the privacy, intimacy, and bond of sex and relationships. It seems to me there is such a fuss over virginity because the expectation is that everyone should want to know as much about sex as possible, preferably through experience with different partners; virgins, for various reasons, resist this discourse. For someone desiring to share sexual awakening with someone, to learn and respond only to that partner's needs and desires, and to place this within the context of a healthy relationship...I don't know if we have a place in society.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Want to tell your story?

I went to college, moved abroad to teach English in France, moved back, and have traveled on four continents. \u00a0I am currently underemployed and not in a relationship, although there are a few possibilities for that on the horizon. \u00a0I move a lot trying to find a good job.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong><br />\n<br />\nSexual contact with someone else's genitals...that kind of intimacy/loss of \"innocence\". \u00a0I think that if you've had oral sex, you aren't a virgin. But of course there are lots of kinds of virginity. Intercourse might be another \"virginity level\" to attain.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us your story</strong><br />\n<br />\nI waited. \u00a0I wanted to be in a relationship when I first had sex... but then I didn't seek out any relationships. When I was 12 my older sister had a baby at age 17, so I was also pretty terrified of pregnancy and STDs for a while. \u00a0I was focused on work and school and just didn't put myself out there. \u00a0I was also suffering from poor body image, and just internalized way too many messages from the media/my family that I was the \"plain sister.\" Both my sisters were married young, I think my little sister even got pregnant before I even first had sex.<br />\n<br />\nI usually told people the truth when playing \"never have I ever\" or when sex came up. \u00a0Towards that last year though, I had one friend I had to lie to, she just wouldn't stop asking about it, I just invented a story around a guy I had actually gone on one date with. \u00a0And I even implied to my mother that I'd had sex when she tried to tell me guys wouldn't be into me if I didn't shave my armpits on the regular.<br />\n<br />\nBut then, last year, almost exactly a year ago, I was sick of waiting. \u00a0I didn't want anything to be awkward with future dates. \u00a0I went out to a bar with a friend, and let myself get picked up by a, in retrospect, horrible guy. \u00a0He was in town on business: ideal, never see him again! It was awesome in that respect, just what in the end I needed. I didn't tell him, I just got it done. \u00a0The bubble bath I took when I get home was better!<br />\n<br />\nAfter that though, I felt more confident to throw myself on the dating market. \u00a0I dated a coworker, slept with the friend of a friend, and dated online. \u00a0I had a \"friends with more\" situation with someone for 8 months and it was awesome. It wasn't until I met him that I had my first orgasms (including multiples! OMG) \u00a0and learned how to really masturbate and get myself off. \u00a0It's been a great year.<br />\n<br />\nIt can be weird to be a late bloomer, because despite my late virginity, I have a very high sex drive and love talking about sex. \u00a0It can be so much fun, but its a difficult line to walk, TMI with your friends or not.<br />\n<br />\nI think in the end, just do what feels right for you. \u00a0I don't regret waiting until I was 24. \u00a0I might slightly regret the anonymous nature of my first encounter, but honestly waiting until I was older to have sex, I had so many more interpersonal and communication skills that made everything so much easier and more fulfilling.<br />\n<br />\n<em><strong>NOTE Just a reminder: We\u2019re getting amazing feedback for our work, but it won\u2019t get finished without your support.
