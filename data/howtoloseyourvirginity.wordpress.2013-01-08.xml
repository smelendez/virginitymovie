We'd love to run it in this blog!</span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tell us about yourself:</span>
I'm a heterosexual female in my early twenties and I'm a virgin. I'm currently single, but have had a couple long term relationships. I grew up in farm country and have recently moved to the big city to pursue my career. I don't know if its more the cultural differences or just the fact that I'm older, but my virginity has never been as much a "topic of conversation" than it has in the last year that I've been here.

I was raised semi-religious and was taught the Christian rules but we didn't really do the church thing. We got the general "Sex is what two married people do" and "Don't get pregnant, use a condom" answers. My parents acknowledged that my sisters and I might have sex, but they hoped we wouldn't. Nonetheless, the "marriage" part stuck with me and I've yet to hear a good reason to believe it should be any different.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How do you define virginity?</span>
To each his own I suppose. Its an interesting debate and people who limit it to "this or that" are missing the bigger picture. I'd go with genital to genital or to anal, to be 100% not a virgin. But a lot of it is really more an emotional experience. If you feel you're still a virgin, then you're still a virgin. I plan on waiting until I'm married to do anything that would require either of us removing our pants.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why did you decide to stay a virgin?</span>
I'm not a zealot, but I believe that ones spirituality and relationship with God is what makes us truly human. Maintaining my virginity is my own way of showing that I can be more than my sexual urges. Its same reason I haven't done drugs or smoked cigarettes. "Because it feels good" is not an answer that will make me a better person. (I probably shouldn't drink either... :-/ Nobody's perfect.) Not everyone will agree with my religious perspectives, but there are a lot of non-religious reasons as well.

Physical-ness is an important part of any relationship, but if I can't find a man who loves me for my heart and my head, he's not the kind of man I want having all of my body. For all you avid blog readers out there, my favorite <a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.postsecret.com">postsecret</a> of all time says <span style="font-style: italic;">"I fake it with you 50% of the time. But I wouldn't want to fake it with anyone else" </span>To me, THAT, is love. Sex is a part of it, but just a part.

Plus, sex can complicate things. In my experience even making out can complicate things.

I have nothing against people who have responsible sex before marriage. I've even tossed the idea around myself. But I think too many people use sex as an emotional band-aid and having random, casual sex usually does more harm than good.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How have your dates/partners reacted?</span>
My first real relationship was over a year long and we never even talked about it, I just always stopped it at some point and he accepted it. My other long term boyfriend agreed that we should wait so that was that. I recently told a man I was interested in that I wanted to wait and I think it turned him off. We're still good friends but when we drink he'll often say things like "It sucks that this girl I really like wont have sex with me." But I figure it's his loss. I don't need anyone who thinks like that.

I'd like to start a relationship, and maybe even fall in love, before the conversation even comes up. A man in love with me would see that I'm worth waiting for (because I believe I am, and I wish more girls would see that they are too) than one who is simply in lust.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Any special plans or ideas for losing it?</span>
On my wedding night with my husband. And I very much intend for it to be hot, very hot.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Anything else you want to say about virginity?</span>
Virginity is just another label that people are asked to try and fit themselves into. I believe too many young girls think they become woman when they have sex and that it's the grown up thing to do. I think in the back of his or her mind is always the thought that "well this is what I'm supposed to be doing, cause this is what normal people do."

Our society (and our parents) put too much energy into teaching bout sex and not enough emphasis on love, emotions, and communication. (Don't get me wrong, I'm all for safe sex ed) But we need to talk more about self worth, girls need to know that sex doesn't define them, and that they are worth waiting for, at least beyond the first date, and on their own terms.

However, if I'm 40 and still not married, there probably is no God, no love, or good men left. I then intend to become the randiest cougar on the planet. Ha ha!]]></content:encoded>

She shares for the first time her story of sexual molestation at the age of 12, and her struggle to reconcile her past sexual experiences, her faith and what she wants out of life. We're grateful for her honesty and courage. </span><span style="font-style: italic; color: #660000;">If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong>. We'd love to run it in this blog!</span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tell us about yourself:  </span>
I am 21 years old, ethnically Latina, culturally mostly American with some very traditional family values. I am currently in my senior year of college, and superbly confused about how to do what I want with my life. I grew up the daughter of a Southern Baptist pastor (yeah, I know I should be Catholic) and I currently attend a nondenominational church where I have strengthened my faith in God, and simultaneously lowered my moral standards. Contradictory eh?

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How do you define virginity?  </span>
I guess for most people that would be vaginal sex. If I was normal, I think that would be my answer anyway. The way I define my virginity is by who I want to remember having sex with for the first time. Therefore, I have decided that I am a virgin.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why did you decide to stay a virgin?  </span>
I guess in the technical sense of the word, I’m not one. I was molested when I was 12 and 13 by a man who was like my grandfather. I was obviously terrified of the whole experience, and while I knew what he was doing to me was wrong, I didn’t know what to do or how to tell. Everything sort of escalated to the night he raped me, and that was my breaking point. I broke down and told my mom, yet I have never ever told anyone that I was raped, not until now anyways. I was so ashamed that I allowed it to continue, even though I was of an age that I should have known better. I obviously don’t blame myself now, but I did then. After that I went on a downward spiral of alcohol and oral sex with older boys until I was about 16.

I obviously was raised pretty conservatively, and so I made a True Love Waits commitment when I was 16, and I sort of straightened myself out. I really stuck to my commitment until recently, as I realized that at 21, I have no intentions of getting married anytime soon, and I simply don’t think I can wait that long to have sex. I’ve sort of come to the conclusion that I’ll have sex when I want to. I’m not sure I believe in all this "the right person" business, but I just think that if I’ve been dating someone and I want to, I will. The last few guys I’ve dated weren’t the greatest, and I couldn’t imagine myself having sex with them. (No joke, the last one had the most obnoxious country accent ever. The way he said my name made me wince.)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How have your partners reacted?  </span>
Well, the only guy I ever tried to have sex with was when I was 15, pre-True Love Waits commitment. He was 19 and quite possibly the hottest guy I’ve ever dated or come close to dating. Our relationship lasted about 5 months, and we did every sort of sexual activity imaginable until it built up to actual sex. I thought I was ready, but once I was down to my underwear I just started crying uncontrollably. I was so upset with myself, but he was really nice about it. He held me until I stopped crying and I think he sort of guessed what had happened although he never said anything. We broke up after that, not because I didn’t have sex with him, but because I was sort of embarrassed not only about what happened, but that he also knew my secret essentially.

The other guys I dated were post-True Love Waits, and so I purposefully chose guys who had made the same commitment, so it wouldn’t be so awkward. Not until college did I date another non-Christian boy, and so it was a little awkward having to bring it up. Most guys didn’t seem to care as they were fairly inexperienced as well. Only one guy seemed surprised, mostly because we had engaged in oral sex (a LOT of oral sex) before we even started dating. He figured I was waiting to have sex until we became official, not until I was married.

The next partner I have I would like to not really say anything. I feel like I’m lying a little bit, and unless we actually get to the sex part I don’t think its really all that necessary.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Any general thoughts on virginity in our society?  </span>
I feel like virginity is so overemphasized in Christianity that it’s annoying. Who really thinks that in an age where people are getting married later, and later that anyone will actually wait until they’re 25, 35, 40? That is just unfair and biologically contradicting. If I was getting married now it would be no problem, but I can’t see myself turning 22 without giving in to temptation. I’m over the religious guilt because it’s not realistic.

Overall in society I think virginity isn’t seen as a good thing. For the most part I was the odd one out of having sex. Out of my 6 closest friends, only 2 have not had sex and its only because they have never had the opportunity. (Neither one has had a boyfriend.) I think we should as a society teach how to make the best decision for yourself, not an end all be all for everyone. At the end of the day its your body and your life – do what you want.]]></content:encoded>

The Guardian (in the UK) just did a story called <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/18/virginity-project-blogging-sex">"Is This Your First Time?"</a> about the work of fellow virginity geek Kate Munro (looking foxy, above) who writes the blog <a href="http://virginityproject.typepad.com/">The Virginity Project</a>. The blog is a fascinating collection of reader contributions about their first sexual experiences (it was the inspiration for our <a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/category/first-person/">First Person</a> series, although I think we have lots more people writing about their <span style="font-style: italic;">lack </span>of sexual experiences).

From the article:
<blockquote style="font-family: trebuchet ms; color: #660000;">Monro seems to have an ability to get people to open up to her and there are many who tell her things they can't even tell their own partner. One of the most candid stories on her blog is the tale of the stay-at-home father of four whose wife, a high-flying lawyer, decided one night to strap on a dildo and take his anal virginity. "I was, to put it mildly, petrified," he says. "The sight of that missile protruding from her, and meant for me, brought everything home."She also has tales we wouldn't usually hear: of a thalidomide boy (lost his to the most popular girl in school, then moved on to her best friend); an autistic man (prostitute) and a 101-year-old woman (out of wedlock, scandalous, but a bit hazy). But the story, she says, that always shocks the most, is that of the man who has been married for 15 years yet is still a virgin. "He had the opportunity to do it but just had an intense feeling he would hurt the woman and couldn't do it," she says. "I think it has just turned into phobia."</blockquote>
The article included an interview with me about our project <a href="http://trixiefilms.com/virgin/index.htm">"How to Lose Your Virginity,"</a> mostly I think because the writer was baffled by our virginity-obsessed American culture. The subhead of the article is <span style="font-style: italic;">"Losing your virginity is one of the few aspects of sex that remains untalked about."</span> Maybe in the UK... I guess they're a lot more reserved over there (meaning their pop stars aren't all flashing purity rings and calling girls without them <a href="http://theamericanvirgin.blogspot.com/2008/09/disney-chastity-league-strikes-again.html">sluts</a>.) Absorbing my tutorials on virginity in pop culture, she writes:
<blockquote><span style="color: #660000; font-family: trebuchet ms;">Like Monro's work, Shechter's film is a series of straightforward tales of real people's virginity loss. It's refreshing to hear such forthright voices in a world where any debate about virginity is often so conflicting or one-sided. Our current torchbearer seems to be <a href="http://theamericanvirgin.blogspot.com/2009/08/sex-young-girls-again-and-again.html">Miley Cyrus</a> who, just like Britney all those years ago, loudly proclaims her own virginity while behaving in a hyper-sexual way.</span>

In the media there are constant stories about women auctioning off their virginity to pay for their education and more troubling is recent news of one <a href="http://theamericanvirgin.blogspot.com/2010/05/reality-show-or-human-trafficking-you.html">Justin Sisely</a>, an Australian TV producer currently looking for young virgins to take part in a new reality show. "You see all this stuff and you think: 'So this is the extent of the debate we're having about virginity in the 21st century?'" says Shechter.</blockquote>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> I'm seriously annoyed she got the description of our film wrong. It's a lot more than <span style="font-style: italic;">'straightforward tales of virginity loss,'</span> for crying out loud! Did she not even watch the trailer? And no links to our blog, <a href="http://theamericanvirgin.blogspot.com/p/about-film-how-to-lose-your-virginity.html">synopsis</a>, or any <a href="http://trixiefilms.com/virgin/trailer.htm">video</a>. Lame.

But her kicker about Kate's and my mission is dead-on: Encouraging a more honest conversation about what our sex lives really look like:
<blockquote style="font-family: trebuchet ms; color: #660000;">"These days we see sex everywhere, but there's very little that's honest about it," [Kate Monro] says. "I think ultimately what brings people to tell me their stories is that we all have an innate desire to want to compare our experiences with other people. We all just want some sort of affirmation to know that we are normal."</blockquote>
We did our own fun interview with Kate Monro <a href="http://theamericanvirgin.blogspot.com/2009/01/kate-monro-wants-to-know-how-you-lost.html">here</a>.]]></content:encoded>

I wouldn&#39;t have that conversation with my parents (that would be too weird) but with my friends, sure, we don&#39;t tend to have too many secrets from each other, and swapping stories (especially if they&#39;re funny) about sex is just another topic of conversation. <br />Certain parts of society probably wouldn&#39;t and as I said, it may be a generational thing. But we&#39;re all pretty open in the crowd I mix with. Well, that&#39;s my two cents anyway.]]></wp:comment_content>

She described herself like this:</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">I'm going on 22 years old. I'm studying Physics and French. I was raised <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">LDS</span> (Mormon), and I still live in Utah.</span>

I have a very high sex drive, and I think it's silly that even secularists act like women aren't sensual, are too "tired" all the time, etc., etc. Also, even though I no longer believe in a Prophet telling me when to say "no," that doesn't mean I'm just going to jump in bed with any schmuck, you know? I still believe in standards, just those that are more self-determined at this point.

The other day she sent this update to her First Person, so we're going to let her take it from here:

Well, I had sex, and have to admit, wonder what some of all the brouhaha is about (from both sides, religious &amp; secular).

To be fair, I had an attentive partner, we'd been in a long-term relationship, I get a great deal of pleasure from many kinds of sexual activities . . . but <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">c'mon</span>, penises are not that dexterous, especially virgin penises. There tends to be screaming and awkwardness and not that much of, well, anything, at least from my novitiate's view.

The foreplay is lovely, of course, but I don't feel like penetrative sex is any sort of revelation to be put to sappy love music. My theory on life is that it improves in your 30s (more money, more mature, and better at sex). But I'm glad I did it, because hey, why not. I also decided that it's less the SEX part of sex that would make random hookups, well, problematic, but a lot of the other stuff. ("Um, hey, where's the bathroom?")

Chick lit books always seem to have decidedly non-virginal Latin lovers to bed you on random steely horizontal (or not!) surfaces, but I don't feel like less of a sexual being just because my experiences have been with an actuary on a bed.

I found the American Virgin website on a link wander as part of my interest in how the fourth wave of feminism is developing. I’ve got a pretty different idea about virginity which has developed over the last few years, where I realised for around 14 years ago that although I was physically no longer a virgin, psychically my virginity was still intact. Despite having 7 lovers, it was only with my dearest soul-mate that I finally lost my virginity, when I learned to make love, instead of having sex.

The fact stands that I waited till I was 22 before I completed the physical act of penis-in-vagina intercourse. I won’t delude myself, like I did at the time, I had waited for Mr Right. He turned out to be Mr Personality Disorder and I had a miserable 7+ years with him. Sexual intercourse with someone with a personality disorder who is bent on destroying your self-esteem is a good way to develop sexual inhibitions, but I look back now and realise I never fully gave all of myself to him. For all the pleasure I gave (and received, as I do enjoy sex) it was just that – sex – not love making.

Once released, by him running off with his 19-year-old-assistant, I set about finding out what I had missed and I had fun, having sex with a string of men, many of whom I am still in contact with and even friends with today. Some I knew before my divorce, others I met along the way. I had great sex, but never made love with any of them. I held back a part of myself, perhaps more than I did with my ex-husband, because of my emotional scars from that relationship.

There was one man who was different from the rest – a professional colleague, someone who was my intellectual equal. Someone whom I had intense conversations with about many things, including spirituality. A married man. We both struggled with the issue of his being married. Becoming lovers was not on either of our agendas, both of us valued fidelity within a marriage relationship. One night, before he was going into a disciplinary hearing at work, and I was resigning from my job, we came together. I started as I had always done with my lovers – to have sex with this man, yet at the point of seeking his pleasure, I found my own and it suddenly became something new. We were making love. We were both vulnerable and exposed, and in doing this we found a new freedom of expression.

The happy ending was not possible at this time – were we to be together, he would lose his daughters in an inequitable family court system which granted custody to the female parent almost without exception. We parted, and agreed no contact was the best approach, him to return to trying to be a husband and a father, me to work out what I wanted from life.

Eight years on, our paths cross again. He is divorcing, I am single. Biggest problem; we live in different countries. Both of us assumed that eight years would have changed who we were, how we were.

No, there was no change, it was like there had been a pause, then a breath of eight years and we were still connected and attuned in a way neither of us had experienced before or since. We now navigate a long-distance relationship and when we are together we make love. I’ve talked to him about my thoughts and feelings on this, and we both share a wicked enough sense of humour that we have been known to say after love making "Damn, we failed to have sex, that was definitely making love."

If someone had asked me what a virgin was at 20, I would have given a strictly physical definition. Now at 40, I know that there is a mental and psychic dimension I’ve been glad to learn and understand.]]></content:encoded>

Today I was reading about stay-at-home daughters and Purity Balls. I thought, "These people are nuts!"

But when I said, as a teenager, "I'm going to be a virgin until marriage," it put me in solidarity with these crazies.

When I think back on why I chose virginity in adolescence, though, I realize that despite being connected with these loons, I wasn't exactly like them. Firstly, I was able to choose it. Stay-at-home daughters don't choose their destiny or how to explore their sexuality. They go straight from home to husband, with no time on their own to even think about getting their cherries popped.

I thought about conversations I had with my mother. Of course, she encouraged me to wait until marriage (she only had one partner before my father, her husband), but she still said, "If you do have sex before marriage, use protection!" So there was never pressure from my mom to stay a virgin "or else." It wasn't so much about being pure because God says that's what purity is (even though that became part of it for me). It was more about protection of my body, heart and soul. Protection of the body from pregnancy and STDs, protection of the heart and soul from the heartbreak of breaking up with someone to whom you lost your virginity. Meanwhile, my dad said, "No dating until you're 16!" I was a little too obedient to that! But he said it was because teenage boys were immature and only interested in sex. I went to an all-girls high school so I don't know if that was true for every teenage boy, but the junior high boys sure seemed that way...

I think there's a difference between telling your daughter to be a virgin to please God and telling your daughter to be a virgin to protect herself. I guess both can be problematic, but at least in the latter it's more about your daughter, not rules. My parents taught me that I shouldn't give it up to a guy that didn't deserve me. My mom told me over and over, "your body is a temple, and was only designed for a king." That statement can be problematic too. I think my body is not just designed for a man's pleasure. But again, that statement is taken out of the context of a discussion of how wonderful a person I am, how precious my body is, and how I shouldn't just throw it around at any guy who flirts with me.

And I never thought for a second that abstinence-only education should be taught in public schools! I went to public schools through junior high. In the late 90's, we learned about abstinence and contraception. I liked that the best protection against pregnancy and STDs was just to not have sex. Obvious, straightforward, and you don't have to worry about taking pills or fiddling with condoms or getting tested...protected sex seemed like such a hassle. Get to the fun already!

Again, my stance is in transition. I don't want to have an oppressive definition of femininity or female sexuality. As a teenager, I didn't feel like I was missing out or that virginity was holding me back from living a full life. My early twenties were quite full and amazing, even without a boyfriend!

But now I do feel like I'm missing out. Now, I feel it's a lie to say being a virgin is still liberating or empowering me, helping me live a full life. Now, something's missing...

And I definitely don't want to be mistaken for the SAHD's or Purity Ball people! But if people still talk to me like someone who's had sex, I guess I'm not as loony as the fundamentalists.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm an eighteen-year-old college student who was homeschooled all the way through high school and somehow turned out normal. I'm a fangirl, an aspiring writer, and completely unable to shut up.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

The state of not having had sex with anyone. I don't have a really concrete definition because I believe it's different for each person. I consider myself a virgin. I have absolutely no sexual experience. Never even kissed anybody.

<strong>Why have you decided to remain a virgin?</strong>

Here's the thing - I don't think about it. There are so many things that I need to worry about and my status as a girl who hasn't hooked up with anyone isn't really one of those things. I'm not "saving it" or anything. It just... doesn't mean much to me. In homeschooler-land, or at least the variant I encountered, the mere idea of losing your virginity before marriage is <em>bad.</em> I don't think that way. My friends, I am certain, will wait. I don't see it like that. Your first time isn't any more significant than any other sexual experience you may have in your lifetime, as far as I know. Maybe when I'm older, maybe once I've found a guy, I'll think differently. I don't know.

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?</strong>

It's overrated. If you're a virgin, you're viewed as naive; if you're not, you're viewed as a slut. Women can't win.

<strong>Tell us about yourself, your age, your background:</strong>

I am an 18-year-old freshmen college student who attends Central Michigan University. I am studying Women's Studies and hope to one day attend law school. I run a tumblr blog where I blog about feminist issues.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

I think virginity is a purely social construct so I don't define it. I think it doesn't exist.

<strong>Why do you feel this way?</strong>

I started feeling this way when I got more involved with the LGBT community. I am not part of the community myself, but many of my friends are. I saw some of them struggle over the definition of "virginity" because society doesn't include people who are LGBT. The more I watched my friends struggle with this concept, the more I realized that virginity in the long run doesn't really matter. It's all relative anyway. Now as a feminist, I believe this more than ever. I don't think people should be hung up about their sexual status. It doesn't matter. <strong></strong>

<strong>What are your thoughts on virginity in our society?
</strong>

I think virginity in society is vastly over-rated. From white wedding dresses to purity balls, society has this obsession with female virginity and I think it's unhealthy.

<strong>Anything else you want to tell us that we didn't ask about?</strong>

I hope that as a society we can move past the concept of virginity. I feel like if we did this it would take a lot of stigma and negativity off of female sexuality. Sexuality should be celebrated, not repressed. However, as much as I want that to happen, I don't think it will in the near future. <strong></strong>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a soon-to-be-21-year-old lady from a small town in the Delaware Valley. I'm currently attending a county college for American Sign Language Interpretation, though I'm thinking of switching to a major with a more creative vein; something to do with writing, being that it has always been something I've enjoyed.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Anyone who has not had sexual, genital-to-genital contact with another person. Oral sex just doesn't count as proper sex in my book, I'm afraid to say.

<strong>Tell us your story:</strong><strong>
</strong>

I do not consider myself a virgin, and have not since the age of 18, when I had sex with a man for the first time. I'm actually glad that my first time wasn't with someone I was in a relationship with; it was casual sex with a friend. I think I'm glad mostly because I was extremely nervous my first time (I think it's safe to say that pretty much everyone is), and thinking about that nervousness on top of the whole "we're taking our relationship to the next level" idea would have made it an absolute train-wreck. Instead, it was almost like just checking something off my life to-do list; getting a milestone out of the way, which I think was very liberating. It didn't have all this weight of expectation because there was none; we were friends, and there were benefits, but there was never going to be a relationship with all the trappings of romance. <strong></strong>

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?
</strong>

I think our society is completely confused on how it thinks it should view virginity, particularly when it comes to the different sexes. For a guy, it's a mark of shame: you're not "man" enough to get it on. What are you waiting for? But for girls, it's this little badge of pride: "I'm pure, I'm special, I'm saving it for someone special." Those ideas are shoved down our throats pretty much since the first day of sex-education, both formal and informal.

I can respect someone wanting to not have intercourse, particularly casual intercourse, because they put value on emotional connection with their partners. In fact, I know several people quite willing to do almost everything sexual BUT have intercourse for that reason. But they do have sexual activity (fingering, oral sex, etc.) with people they like, or are building a relationship with, or even just casual partners. But it drives me up a wall when people carry on this idea of virginity, especially female virginity, as something that should be hoarded out of fear of being labeled a "slut," or because sex is something to be ashamed of wanting and enjoying. Men are allowed, even expected, to masturbate and watch porn and peruse sex (casual or otherwise), but the very idea that a woman can have an active libido, and feed that libido through self-stimulation, pornography, and yes, causal-or-otherwise sex, is somehow scandalous.

And at the same time, women are constantly sexualized by our media. Just look at our advertisements, especially for things like perfumes and alcohol. Women in revealing clothing or positions that suggest sexuality run rampant, yet women are expected to remain chaste. This societal mixed-signal is enough to make anyone confused.

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm 18 and a university student, hoping to eventually become a clinical psychologist. I'm originally from California.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Personally? I just don't. I've tried to define it for myself in the past, but I just can't come up with something that makes sense, and I've found that it's just not a useful word for me.

<strong>Do you consider yourself a virgin? Tell us why.
</strong>

I don't really have an opinion on whether or not I'm a virgin. I wouldn't consider myself one, but I know that some people would, because I've never had sex with a guy. I don't think that's really accurate, though, because I've definitely had sex! I first had a sexual experience with a girl when I was 14, and I wondered for years whether it 'counted' as sex, but now I don't care. I don't think of that experience as 'losing my virginity;’ in fact, when I think about my sexual history, I see every single experience as being part of a gradual decrease in naivety and a gradual gaining of confidence. There has never been a 'loss' of anything. <strong></strong>

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?
</strong>

I think it's weird that people take it so seriously, especially since there are so many different ways of defining it. I also think that fetishizing virginity is counterproductive –it doesn't make anyone put off having sex. It just makes them hide it, which makes them more afraid to educate themselves and be safe about it.

<strong>Anything else?</strong>

I really don't find 'virgin' to be a useful word. If I mean that someone is sexually inexperienced, I'll say that. If I mean that someone is really ignorant about sex, I'll say that (and you can be ignorant about sex even if you've had it before!). If I mean that someone is naïve, I'll say that. Since I stopped trying to define 'virgin,’ I've realized that I don't need the word at all.

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I’m 18 years old, a college student, and am biromantic and biracial.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Virginity is "innocence" from any sort of sexual knowledge.

<strong>Why do you feel this way and how did it happen?</strong>

I started reading smut fanfiction at age 11. I watched my first porn a few months later. I had seen it and just wanted to know what all the fuss was about. Fast-forward to 7 years later, loss of my "virginity," i.e. broken hymen. When I had my hymen broken, I honestly didn't feel different. Just a little sore, and left with a, "Oh, that's...not worth all the fuss and hype..." feeling, and not as in, "Wow, my boyfriend is an awful lay." <strong></strong>

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?
</strong>

I feel like the push for purity is glorifying sex by making it "forbidden." Religious groups tell us that it's a beautiful thing to be shared with another individual. Sex and loss of virginity, in this case via penetration, is hyped up to be this magical thing. They want you to believe that something will change afterwards, when in reality, nothing happens. In my opinion, not worth the hype.

We're very grateful she's sharing her story with us. </span>

<span style="color: #660000; font-style: italic;">According to the <a href="http://blogathon.thecurvature.com/?p=20" target="_blank">CDC</a>, 10% of young women report that their first intercourse was involuntary. This post may be triggering to some readers. 

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I am 20 years old and I'm a student at Kent State University studying Sociology and Nonprofit Management.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Virginity is a social construction that attacks and oppresses female sexuality.

<strong>Tell us your story:</strong>

I do not consider myself to be a virgin and I never really have. I grew up a very reserved child, preferring to play inside on the computer, rather than outside with...people. I guess I missed the parental and peer socialization of the concept of virginity, or at least its stressed importance. When I was 14, I dated a guy, for the first time, who was 17. He raped me and made me come to completely wrong conclusions about sex and sexuality.

I thought that sex was about pleasing someone else. I thought my "job" in a sexual experience was to ensure the happiness of the other person, while my wants and needs were not supposed to exist. Rape was normalized by this relationship with him. It didn't matter that I didn't want to. The first time it happened I learned that what I wanted didn't matter. After saying no, stop, no, you're hurting me, I was told just to calm down, and relax. To not get too graphic I was also told "No, it doesn't hurt. I'll show you what hurts" and proceeded to rape me anally.

Whats worse, aside from the physical aspects, is that I thought that these experiences were sexual and relationship norms. And it's taken over 6 years for me to realize that they're not okay. They aren't and shouldn't be normal. That, what happened, was not love, like he told me repeatedly.  I don't harbor any ill will toward him individually, but I do recognize the larger problems beyond my individual case—men have sex and women merely participate.

When I was 18 I also entered into a marriage with someone who is very similar to the man who raped me year ago, and I was raped many times during the marriage. I hope that my story can help someone. I'm not out of the tunnel, so to speak, but I'm close to the end.

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?
</strong>

Women are not encouraged to be sexual—instead, the opposite. Young women are taught to be "pure" (as if sex is physically and morally dirty and unclean), to be virginal. Virginity is a horrible social construct and it is treated like a universal biologically proven state of being. Virginity isn't questioned; largely, it is merely accepted as a truth.  The virginity myth should be abolished and women's sexualities should be promoted and celebrated.

<strong>Tell us about yourself: </strong>
I am a 17 year old girl. I am currently a senior in High School. I am one of the few girls at my school that is a virgin. [If that makes sense] I live in New Jersey! :} I plan on going to school to study psychology. I am interested in how people think, why they think that way...etc!

<strong>How do you define virginity? </strong>
Someone who has not had sexual intercourse. [Penetration to be exact] I do not consider oral sex to be sex. People think that if a virgin has participated in oral; then, she is no longer a virgin.. I disagree.

<strong>Do you consider yourself a virgin? </strong>
I am a virgin. I have never done anything sexual. I have never given or received oral. I have never fingered myself. Although, I have used a dildo; I have never had a guys penis inside of me. I want to wait until marriage. I want my husband/my first to have all of me. I don't want to be "used" when I give myself away. [No offense] It's hard..being a virgin. I have to deal with the temptations and societal pressures. Not only that, but from guys I like.

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society? </strong>
Virgins are no longer valued. I feel as if virgins are overlooked. Guys no longer want the girls that are saving themselves. They rather have the girls that are willing to give it up. I feel as if..society should promote virginity more and not downplay it.

<strong>Anything else? </strong>
Sex has become so overrated. Sex is supposed to be a special bond. Something two people WHO LOVE one another are supposed to share with one another. Society had tarnished the specialness of it. It's no longer valued or looked at as special because you can get sex anywhere and from anyone now a days. PLEASE VALUE YOURSELVES AND OTHERS. Every person you have sex with leaves with a piece of your mind, body, and soul.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself: </strong>
I'm a 21-year-old Italian girl. I'm a student in philosophy. My family taught me a strong sense of responsibility towards myself and others, so I've always been very demanding about the nature of relationship I wanted, and I was never able to "let me go," even just a little. Moreover, I find it easy to express my opinions or ideas, but very hard to communicate my feelings - it scares me too much. So, I've never being kissed, never been in a relationship, and I'm a virgin.

<strong>How do you define virginity? </strong>
I would say that someone is a virgin because he or she has never reached the point where you totally trust someone, and you're able to completely give yourself to the other person, to love by letting yourself be loved. It doesn't necessarily translate in penetration, but it sure involves body and pleasure.

<strong>Do you consider yourself a virgin? Tell us why.</strong>
I consider myself a virgin, because I've never lived the experience I previously described. I see my virginity as a "not yet opened to someone else" kind of state.

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?</strong>
I think virginity is seen both as a value and as a fault. Virginity as a value comes from the ideal of being "pure," as opposed to the idea that a woman having sex because she wants to is a slut. This is a cultural construct. At the same time, being a virgin means you aren’t sexually desired, in an age when we're taught that our value as women depends on how desirable we are.
Still, the fact of having a hymen or not says nothing about the person. Being able to make an independent choice about your own sexual life is something that must be seen as a value, not the result of that choice.

<strong>Anything else?</strong>
Even if I know that I'm single and a virgin mostly because of my will not to live empty or shallow relationships, I start feeling the pressure, like something in me isn't working the right way, and I hate this clash between my own thinking and "cultural" pressure.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I’m 29 year old and until recently I considered myself a "virgin."

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Because I am a heterosexual female, my own personal definition of virginity was penetrative intercourse with a man. This is just my own personal definition however, because it obviously excludes other situations for people of varying sexual identities.

<strong>Tell us your story:</strong><strong>
</strong>

When I was younger, I had every intention of waiting until I was married to have sex with my husband. As I matured, that idea seemed less and less authentic to me. I no longer identified with such a narrow view of sexuality, but the problem was that I needed my emotions to catch up with my ideas. Somehow what I thought was okay and normal for everybody else seemed wrong and somehow immoral when it applied to me. I had a late start in the dating world, and because of my lack of sexual experience, I was usually dealing with a lot of anxiety around the "virginity" issue.  When I decided to share that piece of information about myself with some of my dates, that was often the last conversation we would have. Those types of reactions led me to consider "just getting it over with" but I knew that wouldn't be a good decision for me to make. <strong></strong>

<strong>Any thoughts on how our culture views virginity?
</strong>

I hate the word "virgin." Ugh. And don't get me started on the whole "white dress and veil" thing either ;-) I don't know why so many people (and media outlets) think it is their business to pass judgment on other people's sexual activity.  Even though I was happy with my decision to remain a "virgin," I had so much shame attached to that label because of what we are all bombarded with constantly from the media: being a virgin is somehow considered laughable and disgraceful. I find that the pressure from the media pushes young people to make decisions and take action with their sexuality that they are just not ready for. Why can't sexuality be seen as the personal journey that it really is? It can be such a wonderful path of self-discovery.
When the time was right for me to take the final step, I just knew. I'm in a loving relationship, my partner did not have an adverse reaction to my "news," and it just seemed silly to wait any longer because I didn't want to. The funny thing is that for all these years, I was building up that final act of penetration to be such a huge deal. Finally, it just meant that I was a little bit physically closer to my partner. All of our previous experiences up until that point were just as intimate, and just as special. I'm happy that I waited as long as I did because it meant that I had what was for me a perfect experience. My only regret is that I spent so many years feeling ashamed and upset and somehow "not good enough" or "not desirable enough" because of where I was on my personal journey.

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a 20-year-old university student, just trying to get through life.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

To me, virginity is the lack of doing something sexual. I think there are many things you could be a virgin in, but obviously the one that causes the most "stress" in our society is penis-in-vagina virginity.

<strong> <strong>Tell us your story:</strong> </strong>

I was 19 when I lost my virginity, to my boyfriend of 6 months. I waited till l was ready for it. I had chances in high school, including the guy I thought I was meant to be with forever. But I honestly hold sex up to a high standard. I think sex is the most intimate and important thing you can share with someone, whether you're a virgin or not. I think you not only have to trust the other person, but you have to know yourself. And I knew myself well enough to know that 14, 15, 16, even 18-year-old me was not ready to have sex. It was not something I wanted complicating my life. I finally "lost" it when I found someone who I trusted, who brought out the best me possible and whom I knew would be able to guide me through it.

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?
</strong>

I honestly think that people hold virginity up to a higher standard then it should be. I remember going through the day after I lost it and feeling that everything else in the world went on normally. I thought that I would feel different, that I would look at my boyfriend different, or that people would react to me different (like they would just know by looking at me that I had had sex).

I don't think virginity is that big of a deal. I think SEX is a bigger deal, and should be treated like it matters. To me, it doesn't matter that some of my friends have never done it before. But I really do care that the ones that have are being safe both physically and mentally have made the right choices for themselves and they don't act like sex means nothing.

One day we were talking about teens and sex (as we often do) and she told us she had sex for the first time at 15 and had no regrets. So we asked Rebecca to get real about the trial &amp; error, pain and pleasure that came along with having sex for the first time.

I was only fifteen when I lost my virginity to a sixteen-year-old boy. Let’s call him Steve. He was my first boyfriend and I was his first girlfriend. As such, neither of us had any experience, and yet it was magical: little candles lit the room, soft music played, he kissed me tenderly, and we both orgasmed for the very first time.

Just kidding. It sucked. A lot.

When I first learned about sex at nine years old, I was, like any other kid, completely grossed out. My mother explained intimacy to me in a scientific and matter-of-fact manner.

Mom: The penis fills with blood, becomes erect, and enters the vagina. Upon orgasm, sperm comes out of the penis and swims to the egg. One sperm out of millions fertilizes the egg.

My thoughts: Ew, gross! Stop telling me this. (A pause.) Wait a second…you and Dad did <em>what</em>?

And like any kid, I thought that <em>I</em> would never, ever do that. But the time came when I felt very strongly about someone. Steve was affectionate, funny, smart, and I trusted that he loved me. I have never been religious, was not planning on waiting until marriage, and was emotionally and physically comfortable with Steve, so why not? This sex thing was what people did when they loved and aroused each other. And of course, there was the matter of curiosity.

I confess that I didn’t know what a condom looked like, and I was a teenager just before the time when everyone began Googling everything. Due to my conservative health teacher’s vendetta against premarital sex—said teacher also brought in a guest speaker to lecture about the evils of abortion—I was completely ignorant to matters of birth control. Luckily, Steve had had a proper sex education, so he showed me all about condoms, right down to leaving enough space at the tip for the sperm so the condom won’t burst. When Steve first ripped open the little square package, I learned that condoms are not made of fabric, as I had imagined, and it suddenly made sense that sperm wouldn’t leak through.

Sex at fifteen and sixteen was a secret between Steve and me for the time being. To this day, it’s not something that I readily admit (oh wait, I’m writing an essay about it). My instinct was to be embarrassed. When I was eighteen, that instinct was reinforced when I traveled to London for two weeks with a group of young women. My non-virgin status came up in conversation one day, and a fifteen-year-old girl couldn’t believe that I had first done it at her age.

"I can’t even imagine," she said, aghast. Her reaction stuck with me like glue.

Another time I was having ice cream with my cousin and his friends and the subject of virginity came up. I said that I had lost mine early, and was planning to leave it at that, but my cousin’s girlfriend asked what my age had been. I lied and said sixteen. She said that she’d been the same age and gave me a high-five. But then I felt bad about lying and added that I’d been having sex for quite a while by then. Awkward laughter ensued.

My parental units were also informed, thanks to a false pregnancy scare. On one occasion when asked about my virginal status, I had gone so far as to look my mother in the eyes and lie. But when my dad asked I was sick of lying and told him that, yes, I was sexually active with Steve. I was not disowned, as I expected. Dad wasn’t even surprised and took me home so we could tell Mom and all have a talk. (Mom wasn’t surprised either.)

But how did the actual act of deflowering first happen for me? The idea was born when I asked Steve if he felt ready to have sex, because I did. He smiled as a tent instantly formed in his pants. A little later, we got naked, I lay down, he put on a condom, and tried to push into me…

And then, holy shit, <em>pain</em>. I pulled away from him. We didn’t get it done on our first attempt. Or our second, or our third. Apparently my body disagreed with my brain’s readiness. Every time Steve began to push into me, I yelped in pain and shoved him away, repeatedly telling him to stop. Going really slowly didn’t work either, because he would just go limp. I don’t recall how many times we initially tried and failed, or how many condoms we wasted. Eventually, to solve my painful dilemma, we positioned ourselves differently, he shoved his way in on the count of three, and then immediately withdrew. I snapped my legs shut and curled up in pain. I wasn’t even sure whether that counted, as Steve hadn’t climaxed (and obviously, neither had I). It was like we were half-virgin, half-not.

The next time was neither painful nor pleasurable for me, but he climaxed, and that’s when I started to officially say that I was no longer a virgin. And that was my "magical" first successful time.

It took a while before I started to feel any pleasurable sensations. I would just lie there under Steve and wait while he did his thing, like a pincushion being prodded over and over again. One benefit was that tampons suddenly fit much more comfortably. But time after time, it was, just lie there and wait for him to finish, and hopefully I’ll feel something aside from pain at some point.

Then, finally, something did feel good as I lay there. Just a little sensation, at first. It grew as we practiced. But never once did I orgasm.

I knew from masturbation what orgasms felt like, and hence I was disappointed to discover that I am one of the many girls who can’t orgasm by intercourse alone. Steve and I used other methods to bring me to climax. But I still enjoy the sensations that do happen during intercourse.

I’ve never regretted having sex at age fifteen. Though we were both extremely young, Steve and I had a rare kind of first relationship in which we were committed and in love; we stayed together for four and a half years and are still friends.

Oh, and as for what became of that little chat I got to have with my parents, well, Dad wanted to clarify a couple of things…

"Does Steve always pull out while he’s still stiff?"

"…Yes…"

"Do you need condoms?" To my horror, Dad reached over to his night table, opened the drawer, pulled out a handful, and offered them to me. As my jaw dropped and I lifted my hands to refuse them, he studied them and realized that they were expired. Would I like him to run out and buy me some more?

Oh. My. God. No, Dad, even as young as fifteen, I was capable of buying my own condoms.

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a 22-year-old woman studying fine art and working odd jobs.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

For several years I've been really uncomfortable with all of the definitions of virginity that I'd heard—all the definitions that I've encountered from other people, even the queer-inclusive ones, seem to focus on a specific moment when one stops being a virgin and gains Carnal Knowledge. Thinking of virginity/non-virginity in such a binary way left me feeling like I didn't really fit in either camp for years. I think lately I've come to think of it as more of an extended scale from one end to another.

<strong>Tell us your story:
</strong>

I learned what sex was when I was around five. I've masturbated for as long I can remember (not continuously, obviously). When I was around nine or ten, I engaged in semi-regular sexual activities with other girls for a little while—but no oral or penetrative sex. I stepped back from sex with other people for years after that, and didn't even date anyone until I was 16. But I was gaining knowledge about sex, both in an academic setting and through masturbation. By most definitions of virginity I had encountered, I was still a virgin, and those of my peers who knew would treat me with disdain and infantilization and shut me down in all sexual conversation until I became more quiet and vague about my sexual "status." I had PIV sex with a man at 21, and didn't feel particularly enlightened by it. I have more regular healthy sex now, and I feel like I'm still learning.

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?
</strong>

I think a large portion of the way we talk about virginity is downright creepy and focuses on a) making stereotypical assumptions about people based on which side of the "line" they say they fall on (the virgin/whore dichotomy), and b) a very voyeuristic perspective, in which people want to know about other people's sex lives for reasons relating to gossip and speculation rather than for informative purposes or creating a beneficial dialogue. I think some beneficial dialogues are arising, though, and that's fantastic!

Well, last week, right before my birthday, I finally took the plunge.  And after I lost my virginity, I thought of three people to tell: My best friend, my college roomie and you for the blog.
<strong>
How did you lose it?
</strong>I met him at a party. I hadn't even planned on going, but my girlfriend texted and it had been such a day that I wanted to let my hair down.  A handsome, 34-year-old Johnny Depp-type, I didn't think he'd be interested, but as the night wore on it was apparent that we needed to get out of there or risk scandalizing the other guests. We went to his place, and hooked up, but no sex.

We spent the next day together, had lunch, snuggled, played video games.  That second night while fooling around, I made the "big reveal." To his credit he was not incredulous, but considerate, asking how far I'd gone, and what I wanted. As things got hotter, he kept asking me, but I kept holding back (though my body's responses belied my words). Finally, going out of my mind with desire, I decided to give in to what I wanted.

It was unlike anything I'd expected.  It wasn't awkward, or particularly painful. But it was unfamiliar... a sensory overload. Thankfully, I was with a guy who knew it was my first time, made communication a priority and cared about making that a good experience.
<strong>
How did you feel afterwards?
</strong>When we were done, he started stroking my face and asked how I felt. And I told him:<em> "That was great, but I don't feel any different. I don't feel used, or broken, or in love, or guilty or like a new woman. I still feel like me...and its fucking fantastic."</em>  I was worried that as much as I've progressed, some vestige of fundamentalist guilt would haunt me afterwards.  So when it didn't, I was thrilled.

And did I mention afterwards he gave me German chocolate cake? Best post-coital offering ever!
<strong>
Any final thoughts?
</strong>Though I'm really into him, before we started, I gave him two conditions:

1. I didn't want our having sex to label us in an exclusive relationship.
2. I didn't want our having sex now to take the possibility of a future relationship off the table, once we got to know each other

"So, even though we're going to have sex, you want to take things slow?"  Yup, because sex does not a relationship make, and its too early, in my mind to start labeling. We want to get to know each other. But it hasn't prevented us from having a really great week, and I'm excited to see how things turn out.

So yeah, happy birthday to me.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a 23-year-old female from Northern California.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Never having had vaginal intercourse.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

Growing up, I was painfully awkward and shy around boys (as well as in general), since I went to an all-girls school for 9 years (kindergarten to 8th grade), then went to a co-ed high school that was predominantly female. I had my first boyfriend when I just turned 15, and we messed around a bit but never had actual sex.

Throughout the rest of high school, I never felt attractive to the opposite sex, except for randomly making out with boys at dances and parties. I felt frustrated and isolated, even though almost everyone else at my high school was also a virgin. I almost believed that sex would never happen for me.

I went off to college, and about two weeks into my freshman year, I got extremely drunk and high at a party and ended up hooking up with an older guy from another college in the back of his car. He called me for three days afterward to hang out, but I wasn't sure how I felt about the whole situation, having gone for so long without having sex, so I ended up ignoring him and never saw him again.

I was angry at myself for not waiting out for someone more meaningful, but then all my college friends started losing their virginity in a similar fashion, and I learned to embrace my sexuality. Since then, I have been with 17 men, including three serious boyfriends, and am now in a wonderful, committed relationship.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself: </strong>

I am a 27 year old white woman–originally from Michigan, but I currently live in New York City. I was raised in conservative community; my family is Catholic.

<strong> How do you define virginity?</strong>

In the past, I would have said virginity was never having penis-in-vagina sex. Now, I would expand that definition to include any sexual act a person hasn't done. So instead of one type of virginity, there are many types of virginities.

<strong>Tell us your story:</strong>

I had my first penis-in-vagina experience when I was 25. When I was a teen, I wanted my first time to be with someone I loved–perhaps someone I would most likely marry. But fast forward 10 years later, and I still hadn't found that person. I was beginning to feel "too old" to be a "virgin." That's not a great reason to have PIV sex, but at the same time I was sick of waiting. I wanted to know what this whole "sex" thing was about.

So, I ended up having sex with someone who I didn't love–which isn't particularly a bad move. It kinda removes the whole sex-is-greatest-expression-of-love-ever of a relationship. I had told my gentleman friend about my situation and he was honored to help me out. We talked about it for a week before–what sexual acts I liked and didn't–the anticipation was pretty hot. The actual experience was pretty painful and disappointing. Practice definitely makes perfect! Afterwards, I decided to cheer myself up by watching The Daily Show.

I wish that I could have had my first PIV experience with someone who I loved, but at the same time, I do not regret my decision. I feel proud of the fact that it was something that I arranged, something that was in my control.

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?</strong>

I don't think the category of first time PIV sex is going to disappear any time soon. However, I just wish our society talked more about sex in general–talked about female masturbation, gay sex, straight sex. If we did, I feel that "The One Virginity" would lose its power.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself: </strong>

I'm a 21-year-old American male Aspie (high-functioning autistic/Asperger's syndrome) undergrad in Environmental Studies and an activist. I grew up in a secular, liberal household in a heavily Catholic community in a fairly conservative part of the state (we elected Bachmann. For multiple terms.) I didn't pay much attention to pop culture or to depictions of virginity growing up, and my two older sisters helped to instill in me from a fairly young age an acceptance of ideas of gender equality and skepticism about traditional sexual and gender ideas.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

The exact definition and importance of virginity in society seems to shift somewhat depending on cultural norms, but generally, virginity is a state of never having had sex. Beyond that, there is a world of hair splitting and semantics over what constitutes sex; I am not going to dictate to the world how these minute questions should be answered.

<strong>Tell us your story:</strong>

I dated for the first time late in high school, and it was short-lived. On my second relationship, which immediately followed that, I did engage in sexual acts, and so am not a virgin.

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?</strong>

I think, from a male perspective, virginity has become a burden and a stigma; men are not *supposed* to be virgins. I think this is a symptom and a reinforcer of a general culture among men that places a primacy on physical sex and on the 'pursuit' of women. That really undermines good behavior towards women, healthy relationships, and a positive and confident conception of masculinity, and so it needs to change.

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a 21-year-old woman, currently studying a Masters in Entomology (bugs!). I am an inveterate fan of Star Trek, the X-files, Fringe, books in general, baking and Labrador Retrievers. I have a supposedly Christian upbringing.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

It would have to vary with sexual orientation, as there isn't really any unifying theme between the actions of the various types. The only commonality I can think of is having been brought to orgasm by the biological (dildos don't count!) actions of another. I suppose that means you could lose your virginity from a successful hand-job.

<strong> <strong>Tell us your story:</strong> </strong>

I'm definitely still a virgin, alas; years of social ostracism (I'm a nerd, something that will never change, regardless of what others think) and Protestantism make for a fairly toxic mix of neuroses. Only one boyfriend to date, whom I couldn't buck up the courage to sleep with.

I have the intense feeling I'm missing out on something, but I'm too scared to do anything about it.
<strong></strong>

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?
</strong>

I find the idea that one's worth could be defined by the presence or absence of a hymen degrading and ridiculous. At the same time I can't help but worry at how fast the children of the West become sexualized.

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a 20-year-old, feminist college student from the Midwest who plans on going to law school. Oh, by the way, I've never had a boyfriend.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

I define virginity as sexual innocence—someone who has never fully connected with another person (haha) in a romantic way so that they could be open about their sexuality.

<strong>Do you consider yourself a virgin? Tell us why.
</strong>

I do consider myself a virgin. I just have never had a significant other that I have felt open with about my sexuality. <strong></strong>

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?
</strong>

Women cannot win. While male virginity is basically meaningless female virginity is supposedly EVERYTHING—however, if you are a female your virginity doesn't belong to you, it's something you give up. I feel like the societal standard for women is so outdated and we need to stop reinforcing it.

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm 18 and from England, and I lost my virginity last year.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

To be a virgin means to not have had sexual intercourse with another person. I think that if you've had oral sex but not penetration, then you are still a virgin.

<strong> <strong>Tell us your story:</strong> </strong>

I lost my virginity to someone who I loved, but as 18-year-olds, we were and are not married. The big first time experience was not all that and I don’t think it really matters who your first time is with, as I think the main thing is to experience sex with someone you love at some point in your life. Sex is what you make it - fun, loving, exciting - so why just keep it in the 'marriage boundaries'? <strong></strong>

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?
</strong>

Society judges everything, especially virginity. For a male to be a virgin, where I come from, is bad. For a female to be a virgin is also bad. But if you've had sex younger than a certain age, then that's also bad. I feel as though there’s a time period in which to be a virgin is acceptable and when it’s not. Virginity is a personal thing and it's not fair for other people to judge and question what another person has, or hasn't, done.

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I am a High School senior; Class of 2012!!! WOOT WOOT! I plan on going to college and becoming a psychologist. I really want to help mentally challenged people or people with illnesses. They are human, equals and we should love them, despite their sicknesses or brain functions, you know? By the way, I am a virgin and I plan on waiting until I am married.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

You know what? I've sat here for hours trying to come up with a politically correct or educated way to define virginity. I guess it's whatever you want it to be. Personally, I feel as if a virgin is someone who has NEVER been penetrated BY A PENIS.

<strong> <strong>Tell us your story:</strong> </strong>

I am a virgin. I first off want to say, it is hard. There are soooo many temptations and societal pressures. Pressures from "friends," boys, even family. I would like to wait until I'm married. I want my husband to have all of me, unused, untouched. I feel like I owe that much to him... Being abstinent is one of the hardest things to live out in today's society. People often have this screwed up perception about virgins, that we are too afraid or naïve or that we cannot find that right one, which is bogus.

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?
</strong>

Society praises sex. Society puts a lot of "shine" on sexual things. Sex sells. Virgins do not get as much praise as they should—not saying that non-virgins are any less than virgins. But, virginity should hold more value. Nowadays guys would choose the non-virgin over the virgin, which I find completely outrageous. Society constantly tries to find ways to down or bash the virgins and it should not be that way.

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a 23-year-old from Brisbane, Australia. I'm studying engineering at university, with one year left of my bachelor's. I love snow, mangoes and having baking adventures with friends.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

If you'd asked me that a year ago, I would have said that it's the state of having never experienced P-in-V. That's the standard definition, and I never really questioned it. But now I think that this is too simplistic. Not that it isn't a big deal. Particularly for me, as a girl, allowing somebody to go beyond touching the outside of my body and to actually enter *inside* my body is definitely significant. The inside of my head, of my heart, of my soul, and of my body, are very private places that belong only to me.

But virginity isn't a loss. It's part of a gradual gaining of experience that starts the first time you confide in someone, or kiss someone, or share something private. And with the right kind of experience comes wisdom and empowerment, not devaluing and loss.

<strong> <strong>Tell us your story:</strong> </strong>

Strangely enough, the way it happened for me was exactly the way it's "supposed" to happen. Here I was, 22, having decided that I would only want to lose my virginity in the context of a committed, loving relationship (the modern version of "not until marriage"). I had totally swallowed the subliminal propaganda that girls shouldn't want sex or should at least try and hide it if they do, and thus had no knowledge of my own body or sexuality whatsoever. I was totally chaste and pure, or from another perspective, uneducated, uninformed, powerless and totally vulnerable to manipulation.

But I was lucky. I fell deeply in love and this love was returned. My partner and I have taken this whole journey of experience together, the first time for both of us. No pressure or expectations, just learning and loving and laughing. I'm learning about my body and my sexuality regrettably late, but I'm incredibly lucky to have experienced it in the best way possible for me.

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?
</strong>

The focus is just wrong. Let's place value on gaining experience in the right way, instead of placing stigma on losing innocence in the "wrong" way. Girls should never feel ashamed or ignorant about their bodies, or ashamed if they're *not* ignorant about their bodies. How many of you girls out there have actually looked at your own vulva in a mirror, or seen photos of a vulva? I sure hadn't, not until I was 23 and after I lost my virginity. Wrong order!! Boys also shouldn't feel pressure to be sexually experienced. It's totally okay to be at whatever stage you're at, whoever you are.

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I am an 18-year-old female sociology student at Aquinas College. It is catholic—I am not. I have a fascination with all topics relating to sex, women, gender and popular culture.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

I define virginity in shades—i.e. penis in vagina virginity, anal virginity, oral, etc.

<strong>Tell us your story:
</strong>

I am not a virgin, by my definition, including all shades. I have only had sex in committed relationships, though I don't want that to be the only way I ever experience it. I think that being comfortable with sexuality is very important, especially for women. For a very long time I was extremely uncomfortable with giving oral sex, perhaps because I had been told that it was 'degrading.' I have found that I have a much higher sex drive than my partners, something which they have commented on as being 'uncommon.' Losing my virginity, especially to another virgin, was not very pleasurable, and I worry sometimes about the people who are overly fixated on their first time being 'magical' or whatever. Sex and sexuality are journeys that only get better with time. <strong></strong>

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?
</strong>

The focus on female virginity is only detrimental to gender equality—only once people stop seeing young women as things to be 'protected' can women really be equal in our society. Never regret, only learn and grow.

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a 30-year-old female raised in a fairly hick town by fairly Irish-Catholic parents. This upbringing most definitely impacted my experience with sex and sexuality.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

I think virginity is a dying concept that will hopefully one day be obsolete. Virginity can't be based solely on penile-vaginal intercourse. There is no way anyone could argue to me that two lesbians in a sexual relationship are virgins. The concept of virginity has been used in damaging ways for way too long. However, at the time that I "lost" (where did it go!?) my virginity in the "male-penetrating-my-genitalia-with-his-genitalia" kind of way, I did think of it as the moment I was no longer a virgin.

<strong>Tell us your story:
</strong>

I was in a (seemingly) fairly healthy and communicative long-term relationship with a boy the end of my junior year of high school and through the first semester of college.

He was the first boy I had any sexual contact with beyond kissing.  In a lot of ways, he taught me everything I know about sex, and our experiences inform my sex life even now—in healthy and unhealthy ways. I wasn't interested in him romantically the first time that we kissed. He was a friend and I had a crush on his best friend. However, all of our friends had left for college and I figured, why not, we have to entertain ourselves somehow. Even though I was tentative on many levels, kissing him was fine and compelling. That first day he kissed me, he also fingered me for a minute. It was dry and straight all the way in, all the way out. There was nothing even remotely stimulating about it and I was terrified.

Eventually, we ended up in a comfortable sexual relationship. He took it slow, helped me figure out what I liked, bought me a vibrator (terrifying!), taught me how to use my hands too when I was going down on him. Overall it was fun and interesting and exploratory. I trusted him because he was more experienced and I thought he was in love with me.  I don't know if I was ever in love with him.

I didn't have penile-vaginal intercourse with him for about a year.  I did "everything else" with him and thought it was fun and playful.  But there was always the nagging. He really wanted me to have sex with him. By this time, he was 19 years old and I was 17. He had already had intercourse (apparently with 19 women, I later found out).  To him, when you loved someone and you were in a sexual relationship with him or her, there was no reason not to cross that line. To me, it was terrifying. I was raised to believe you would go to hell if you had sex before you were married, not to mention STDs or pregnancy. Already what I was doing was questionable in the eyes of God, my parents and my religious teachers. None of my close peers were having intercourse, so they weren't helpful in providing guidance. My parents would have been horrified if they knew I was even making out with him, so I was incredibly secretive about the entire relationship.  I had no one to comfortably talk to about sex except my boyfriend. And all he was saying was "Get over it, let's do it!" from day one.

A year into dating him, on the night of my graduation from high school, it finally happened. I didn't agree to it. We didn't talk about it. I wasn't even sure what was going on. We were just making out one minute, and the next minute, we were having sex.  No lube. No condom. No desire. No conversation. The next minute, I was sobbing uncontrollably. He hugged me and held me and told me it was okay. The problem was that once it happened, it became an expectation. The fun and playfulness of other aspects of our sexuality were cut short because it was assumed as soon as we started kissing that we would move on to "real sex." I never once consented to this happening but felt trapped by the situation. There were times I would be lying on my stomach crying and he wouldn't stop. It took looking back and reflecting years later for me to know just how abusive and manipulative the relationship was.

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?
</strong>

I think virginity is still unnecessarily glorified. Here is the thing: teenagers are having sexual relationships. If I wasn't made to believe it was such a huge deal, I would have been empowered to make better decisions about it, had more people to talk to, and felt comfortable with the entire concept. The idea of waiting until you are married is silly and outdated. What an awkward and unpleasant honeymoon.  Virginity is a way to control women's sexuality and desires through societal norms.  You can't give it away. You can't lose it. It doesn't matter. You just need to do what is right for you and take care of yourself. Everything else is nonsense.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks so much for posting my letter!
I think this website/video is a strong and powerful and important idea. Though my story is certainly not a positive first experience, I have grown and changed over the past 13 years and certainly figured out how to approach things from a healthy, sex positive place. It's always a top priority to me that people have access to sex positive education, so I've made a list of positive resources on my blog: http://sexuallyoriented.wordpress.com/sex-resources/ Thanks again for posting!]]></wp:comment_content>

R. from Charlotte, NC, who talks about her New Year's plans, which came a bit early. If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong></span><span style="color: #660000; font-style: italic;">. We'd love to run it in this blog!</span>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a 25-year-old administrative assistant for a construction company. I have every intention of breaking away to join Charlotte Fire Department as a public servant by September 2012.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

I don't define it. I suppose I define it as a word that is used by those too uncomfortable with themselves to accept that it just doesn't matter.

<strong>Tell us your story:
</strong>

I didn't become comfortable with myself until I reached college. I'm 5'10" and 160lbs of muscle. I always felt like I intimidated guys in high school so I never thought any of them would give me the time of day. I met Jim and started dating him. We had about four months of just straight making out before we proceeded to any of the other "bases" (might as well use an outdated anecdote). It was very uncomfortable because it was the first time for everything for both of us—I don't remember it being uncomfortable though. We were so close, so in love. Nothing was ever weird between us. We had decided in December that we would wait until New Years Eve to "hit a home run." That was probably my idea, as I was thinking it was some magical moment (**Spoiler alert!! It's not!!**). I don't know how many times I was told you can't have it back, that you'll never be able to undo the deed. Oh but I loved Jim—I'm not Catholic like the rest of my family, so I was okay with sex outside of marriage, but I was still holding onto the idea that he HAD to be the one.

Anyway, back to the sex: We didn't end up making it to January 1st. It happened on December 30<sup>th</sup>—I suppose one of us was just too horny. I remember distinctly how long Jim spent in the bathroom trying to get the condom on, how there was very little foreplay, how I wasn't overwhelmed with pain, how I didn't bleed, how much longer it lasted than what I had been told, how during coitus I thought, "this is it?" Don't get me wrong, Jim had all the right parts and he put them in all the right places, but there was no magical moment. No fireworks (damn, I should have waited one more day!). It was there, and then it was gone. It didn't change me. It didn't change my relationship with Jim. We continued dating for another two years and have since moved on. Sure, I won't forget that specific act because it was awkward and scary and I remember lying on the bed while he was in the bathroom and I was shivering—not from the cold but from all the millions of things I had been told.

I think the best part of it all, the part that made me realize that it's society and my family and my waiting-for-marriage friends who forced me to feel that way, was a few days later after I had told my best friend, she brought me a potted plant of tulips. She said it's a ritual in her family for women to receive flowers from their mothers after they lose their virginity. I'm not sure why that meant so much to me. I suppose it was because not many people celebrate having sex outside of marriage.

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?
</strong>

I think so much pressure is put on women no matter the age to act "appropriate." Women aren't allowed to be sexual beings, they are only allowed to be used as such. Virginity is just one of the many ankle weights that is destroying self-esteem in so many young women. I would never say that everyone should have sex before they are married, but if we were to do away with that construct, would anyone still wait? I just think when you're ready, you should have all the pressure against you.

If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong></span><span style="color: #660000; font-style: italic;">. We'd love to run it in this blog!</span>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I am a 22-year-old sex-positive feminist, about a 0.5 on the Kinsey scale, though I've yet to act on my attraction to women.

I was a late bloomer, not getting my first kiss until I was almost 20. This was frustrating because I was a sex-educator through Planned Parenthood in high school, so there I was, teaching about birth control and STIs while I couldn't even get kissed. However, being a sex educator, knowing the facts, and teaching abstinence as an equally valid choice (even though I hadn't exactly chosen it) made me feel more comfortable with being an inexperienced virgin.

I used to say I hoped to one day have many one-night stands, but for the First Time I wanted to be in love with the guy, because who knows how I'd react—what if I fart or cry? But that view didn't last.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Usually instead of defining virginity, I dismiss it as a harmful social construction. I define virginity ex post facto by if I feel like I can claim I "lost" it after a sexual act. There are multiple virginities, for example, for a hand job, penis-in-vagina (PIV) sex, penis-in-anus sex, phone sex, etc. And that's keeping it vanilla.

To define virginity by only PIV sex excludes queer sex and ignores my sexual reality, which is that I (and many women) get off on clitoral stimulation, not from vaginal penetration. I don't like a definition of sex that is phallocentric, one-sided, and doesn't factor in my own sexual agency.

<strong>Tell us your story:
</strong>

When I was 21, I was fooling around with a boy and gave him a hand job and he orgasmed. I considered that a form of sex, yet there was nothing penetrative about it, so I felt a little uneasy telling people that I was no longer a virgin. (Interestingly, two years before, a guy touched my vagina but didn't penetrate, but I didn't consider that to be as valid, perhaps because I didn't yet think to question the validity of virginity.)

A few months later I met a guy and really clicked with him. I had never clicked with a guy so quickly and so intensely before. On our second date I went to his place to watch a movie and ended up sleeping over, both literally and metaphorically. He put his fingers and his tongue in my vagina, and I rubbed my vulva against his penis, and after that I decided that I wasn't a virgin. I wanted to have PIV sex but he wanted to wait, out of concern that it was my first time and we weren't really together. Our relationship ended a few days later, and I regretted that we hadn't had lots of PIV sex so I could definitively end my virginity and improve my skills.

I'm seeing someone now and have told him that I have had sex but not a lot of it. He probably assumes that means PIV sex, and I haven't corrected him yet; I'm not sure if I will. When we do have penetrative sex for the first time, I will tell him to go slow.

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?
</strong>

Just because a person has had (PIV) sex once, and thus isn't a virgin anymore, doesn't mean they know what they are doing now or will be any good at it, or that sex will no longer be painful for the penetrated partner. There will always be a First Time with each new partner or sexual act, and it's always important to check in with your partner and have active consent, whether it's the first time or the 96th. Instead of thinking of virginity as this monumental milestone to take or lose or bequeath, it should just be synonymous with "first time." If you do something once, so what? It's not like that makes you an expert. Keep practicing!

As a frustrated late bloomer, I was relieved to cast off my virginity. A part of me worried that, as a virgin, I didn't have as much credibility when I said virginity didn't matter, as if people would think I only held that view to minimize my shame of being a virgin. Now on the other side, I wonder if people will assume I discount virginity to minimize my supposed shame at not being a virgin.

<span style="color: black;">Having sex had nothing to do with it, because to this day I have not engaged in any kind of partner sex. My Catholic upbringing regularly impressed notions of chastity, purity, sexual repression, and guilt guilt guilt. I have been socialized with the idea that if you get to 22 and you haven’t had sex yet, there’s something wrong. I was sure being overweight had something to do with it. I was sure my personality had something to do with it. As I got older, I was sure my lack of experience had something to do with it. There’s got to be something wrong with me, or my body, or my way of life.</span>

But here’s the thing: there isn’t.

The revelation of my not-virginity came to me in pieces. The first was while I was skyping with Becky. We were talking about me being a virgin, despite the fact that I know more about sex than a lot of people. Despite the fact that I am better than most people at talking about sex. Despite the fact that I am extremely familiar with my body, my desires, my needs. The second half of this revelation was a day later while re-reading <a href="http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/about-yes-means-yes/">Yes means Yes!</a>, particularly in an essay by Hanne Blank about "process-oriented virgins". I have subscribed to a transitional approach to virginity for a while, but in my brain claiming "not virgin" still required experience with some kind of partnered sex. Why is "virgin" a label people people can claim despite conventional evidence to the contrary? Why isn’t "not-virgin"? And of course, it is.

I still carry with me a lot of the implications virginity has on my life. Sometimes I am sort of terrified by the idea of flirting because it might lead to some kind of relationship (friendship or romantic) and I would feel weirdly obligated to reveal my virginity and they would scoff and leave me alone. Now I can start regularly thinking "I am not a virgin", acclimating to the idea, and letting those words sink into my daily actions.

I am not here to stabilize notions of virginity or female sexuality. I am here to claim my body as my own and claim my experience as valid. I have never engaged in partner sex, and I might never choose to do so. I have decided, here and now, not to be burdened by the label of virgin.

I've worked many different jobs. Usually it is the lower class, lower paid jobs where there is much talk of sexual bravado. Many guys talk about Friday from 5pm to early Monday morning being one long porn movie. The guys who don't participate in the bravado are looked upon as unmanly, gay or inexperienced.

Being tight-lipped will get you this reputation. This is a form of sexual harassment many men must endure that really isn't talked about in society. Even if they lose their virginity at 18, they will hear boasting in the locker room at 16 and feel either left out or try to make something up to fit in.

Most of this bragging is about status and power. It's kind of like someone driving an SUV to "prove" they have value. You can see in many of the posts of older male virgins the cruelty they have been subjected to. There is inequity and power play between the haves/have nots.

I remember other males boasting about sex. My feelings were very different. Even though I love sex there were and are many awkward moments. You'll never hear a guy bragging about the difficulty about getting a condom on, awkwardness about different positions, trouble getting in there or sliding out in the throes of passion, coming too soon etc...

Ironically, I didn't feel more masculine/powerful after losing my virginity. First time was awkward and I was happy to have it over with, like finishing finals at school. I did not have any male friends to discuss the experience with. Obviously I did not discuss with my family. I did not have any contact with the girl afterwards.

I felt that skydiving was more of a step towards manhood and realized that I had done something most men and woman will never try. This is somewhat elitist, I also somehow feel more "experienced" when discussing the use of psychedelic drugs to someone who has never tried.

Now I realize I have ranted....

I was trying to get to the point that sexuality is a measure of power in some circles. It seems that sex is easily had via prostitutes/one night stands etc. Though I have indulged in this lifestyle without guilt or serious consequences, I do not recommend it.

Now something much rarer is love and acceptance. The only human who loved me was my long-gone grandmother. Most people try in vain to find this in relationships.... My parents had a bitter marriage. The virgins fear they are missing out on sex and closeness to another. My experience is the sex part is easy, the closeness part I might not have in this life.

There is an excellent G'N'R video where Axl Rose comes off a bus stop with a straw of hay in his mouth; presumably coming from a small town where he had no friends and his family misunderstood him. After a few years in the "jungle" he would've experienced things that people in his small town can only imagine. That has kind of been my path in life.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I am 22 and ready to be married. Not to "get" married–to be married and to be a partner in that marriage. I am also well educated, ambitiously furthering my education and career, and thus spend a great deal of time living in remote rural areas in a developing country. Given my personality, background, and beliefs, I am certain marriage is the best path for my life and I am ready to begin this journey with someone. I am struggling with the frustration that my lifestyle, while a product of my interests, abilities, and desires, does not allow me to cultivate a serious relationship–and I will not settle for anything less than I know I need.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

I believe in the sacredness of the privacy between a couple. To me, virginity is not something that is taken or lost--it is something added to the relationship between two people who care about each other and are aware of the emotionally components of sex.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

I am a virgin and believe I will wait to have sex until the man who will be my husband makes his intentions clear. While religiously contemplative, my feelings stem from my relationship experience, too complex to recount here. I am looking forward to sex and took joy in sharing my sexuality–though not sex–with an ex-boyfriend, who also viewed sex as a commitment and bond to be shared with the person he would marry. For me, being a virgin is not the product of lack of sex life. It is the result of the relationships I have chosen and expectations within those relationships. I am seeking a relationship characterized by faithfulness, courage, constancy, respect, love, loyalty, and joy. If I accept anything less, including a casual approach to sex, it would be with the self-knowledge that I know what I need and want and settled for something much less, and I can think of no worse way for me to inflict emotional self-harm. Unfortunately, I sometimes feel...sorrow: I am ready to begin a life I cannot choose and that may not be in my future.

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?</strong>

I think our society has taken the joy out of sex by seeking to erase the privacy, intimacy, and bond of sex and relationships. It seems to me there is such a fuss over virginity because the expectation is that everyone should want to know as much about sex as possible, preferably through experience with different partners; virgins, for various reasons, resist this discourse. For someone desiring to share sexual awakening with someone, to learn and respond only to that partner's needs and desires, and to place this within the context of a healthy relationship...I don't know if we have a place in society.

She's 26 now, but this tale of doctors, mothers and pap smears happened when she was a couple months shy of 17.

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a 27 year-old Canadian who has happily immigrated to the antipodes. While I wouldn't change anything about my life thus far, it is still important to point out the things that were messed up about the community I came of age in and the general attitude towards teens and sex that existed.

<strong>Tell us your story:</strong>

I grew up in a town with a high teenage pregnancy rate as well as the highest occurrence of syphilis in the province–not to mention other STDs. I was in grade 11 and about to head off on my first full summer away from home without my parents when my mom decided that, in case I get raped, I should go on the pill.

For some reason, my mother brought me to the emergency ward of our small town hospital to get this prescription instead of to my parents family doctor. When I finally see a physician, he tells my mom that he will need to perform a pap smear.  I was cool with this, and when I think back on it, he had my health at heart and likely had to deal with a lot of young women who either kept their sexual activity a secret from their family or were uninformed about STDs.

My mother, however, freaks the fuck out, repeats to him and all the staff that I am a virgin (which I was,  a fact which disappoints me almost a decade later). So, after four hours spent at a hospital, we come home empty handed and mom finally calls the receptionist at her usual clinic. I get in the next day and get my pills without an exam.

Flash forward two years later and I am in university on the opposite end of the province. My mother constantly told me that she rather I come home with an STD than an engagement ring, but the moment I mention that I'm going to change my pill prescription and have a pap appointment booked, she starts to cry on the phone, sobbing that I shouldn't let a doctor take my virginity.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Well, I certainly don't agree with my mother that the doctor took my virginity, nor did I lose my virginity when I bought a hilariously oversized dildo for the sole purpose dealing with my hymen (you know, to remove my anxieties about bleeding/discomfort in anticipation for real first time sex). For me, I define my virginity as a time when I was unable to engage and connect with people, when I felt unattractive and definitely projected to people that I was unavailable and unattractive.  I was embarrassed due to being a virgin in my 20s and the most true to life quote I have ever heard has come from the character George Lass from the late,great show "Dead Like Me": <em>Death is kind of like sex in high school. If you knew how many times you missed having it, you'd be paralysed.</em>]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I am a stylish and independent heterosexual woman about to turn 30 who lives in the Western United States. I have a Bachelor's Degree and work full time. I enjoy reading, music, history, fashion, lattes, learning new things and going to indie films–among other things.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Never having sexual intercourse. I'm on the fence about oral sex.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

I never thought that I would be a 30-year-old virgin who has never had a boyfriend or even full on made out with a guy. I always thought things like that would "just happen" whenever I would have my first serious relationship. I thought maybe in college or through work or through 'mutual friends.' Well, that never happened.

I see it as a combination of my personality (quiet/introvert/non-flirtatious) crossed with circumstance (work in industry with crazy hours and lived in places without a lot of single people around my age), crossed with possibly Western society focusing more on sex as opposed to relationships. Although I was never the hot chick in school or even the hot chick now, I put effort into my appearance so I can feel better about myself and maybe not look like someone as inexperienced as I am (if there is a look of inexperience that exists).

Although I grew up Catholic, I wasn't one of those people that wanted to be married before having sex. I figured I was being realistic. A lot of people over a certain age are virgins for religious reasons, but not me. I can't get a first date, yet alone a boyfriend. Plus, I am not going to have sex on the first date or the third.

Whenever I see a couple in the street–especially ones around my age–I wonder how they first met and how they were able to connect. Seeing that is the only time I ever get jealous. I almost want to do a survey where I randomly ask all the couples I see how they met.

Even though I have friends, they are all married and have nobody to hook me up with. I am popular at work, but once I leave that job chances are I'll never talk to them again. I do a lot of things by myself and see good looking men wherever I go, but have no idea on how to engage them.

I've checked out dating web sites but am not ready to do them seriously. Most couples I know did not meet online, they met in real life.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm 20 years old and from Australia

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

A person who has not engaged in sexual intercourse. Mind you, I do not believe oral sex etc. is sexual intercourse.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

I was 19 when I lost my virginity and I was drunk. It was with a friend's friend who was younger than me. We both were drunk. Actually, I was kind of desperate to lose it. I felt an insane pressure to be a person who had sex. So, I did. The morning after, I didn't regret it. I don't really speak to the guy at all and I started sleeping with other people. I don't think it'll affect me until I find someone to fall in love with. I've never had a boyfriend, mainly just one night stands.

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?</strong>

It's ridiculous. I have some friends that are still virgins and I always say to them: WAIT until you find someone you LOVE. I wish I listened to my mothers advice, I guess! So much emphasis is placed on virginity. If you've had sex, you're a slut. If you haven't, you're a frigid prude. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a 21 year old university student, and self professed super geek, been ready for sex for ages, can't read signals from boys well at all. Or give them well. I was a virgin up until very recently.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

I always just went with the 'penetration' one. But I got curious as to what others thought a while ago, and opinions varied widely, from orgasm, hymen breakage, loss of innocence, any sexual contact. But I suppose I still consider it vaginal penetration for a girl.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

I'd been wanting to have sex for a while now. I was kind of sick of being the only virgin left in my group of friends from High School. So last week, I'm told by one of the guys I actually do like, (had been attracted to him for a while now, but just assumed he was never interested) that people thought I only liked one kind of guy and maybe that's why they don't hit on me. I was shocked. And annoyed. I made it clear, that is not the case. So I decided maybe now was the time to make a play.

I've never considered sex a big deal, so I didn't need to love a guy to want it. For this, it was more like lust. Ended up going round his place. We played games, drank a bit, watched stuff, until really early in the morning. As it was raining and freezing, I couldn't exactly go home now, could I? I was aiming to stay the night regardless of if anything  happened. I like sharing a bed with a guy, spooning is cosy. But I got more than spooning, which I am glad for.

He started by feeling me up, which got me the most turned on I've ever been I think. The anticipation. He seemed good with his hands though no frame of reference. He made me orgasm 2 or 3 times with his fingers. I thought I'd be really embarrassed about someone touching me down there, but I was OK with being touched by him. We made out for a while before we actually had sex. It stung more than anything. Could have been much worse I imagine. I think I got off lucky.

So I can tick each base off. I feel kind of bad that he did pretty much all the work though. I was a little scared to actually touch his penis, but I can work my way up to that. Fanfic has helped me thus far, taught me a lot of tricks too, which I can now start to use.

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?</strong>

I think virginity values have switched. Before it used to be a good thing if you were a virgin, but now it's less valued, and if you don't lose it when you're younger, you get looked down upon. And I think that sucks. That childhood is getting invaded by things I always thought could wait till later. Losing my virginity hasn't changed me. I feel exactly the same. But I'm still glad I didn't do it when I was like 13/14/15, I was soooo childish still then. Some people can be ready then, but I don't think I was.]]></content:encoded>

The second time was better, but she was also more comfortable with sex. If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong></span><span style="color: #660000; font-style: italic;">. We'd love to run it in this blog.</span>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a teacher and a writer with a background in anthropology.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

It's a completely personal definition - having had sex with both men and women, I would consider the first time with each to be losing my virginity.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

When I was 19, I lost the textbook penis-in-vagina virginity to my boyfriend, a man of my own age that I had dated for a year and who I was completely in love with. We had talked about having sex beforehand and while we bought condoms, hoping it would "happen naturally", we ended up planning it out like a military operation. It was painful and I didn't come, though I think my boyfriend did. Afterwards I fled to a friend's room, but since she was a virgin herself, she took me to one of her friends who was sexually experienced. Lots of hugs and encouragement ensued. Through practice, my boyfriend and I ended up having pretty darn good sex, if I do say so myself.

Interestingly, I later ended up losing my sex-with-a-woman virginity to the sexually experienced friend that I talked to on that first night. By that point I was in a relationship with her. My first experience with a woman was much more relaxed and pleasurable than my first relationship with a man. However, I think that difference had a lot to do with my increased understanding of my own sexuality and comfort with my body, which I gained through sex with men.

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?</strong>

Firsts are always important, but the concept has become detrimental to the individual's pleasure. I think most people, especially women, have a crappy or neutral first experience. And that's OK! Practice makes perfect, believe me. We shouldn't put virginity on a pedestal, and I think it's OK to share your body with people that you love and trust without it somehow detracting from your value.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a quiet guy, 51 years old, from NSW, Australia.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Never having the opportunity to experience sexual intercourse with a lady.

<strong>Tell us your story:</strong>

I'm 51 and a virgin. I have had many thoughts run through my head about this as the years kept rolling by. What is wrong with me? Then, I actually started thinking that maybe I'm special in a way; a shy virgin. Over the years I've been on some dates with women, but when it came to sexual intercourse, I was a complete nervous wreck and failure. Now, at 51, I'm still nervous and shy around women and if for some reason I was put into this position, I think it would be even more difficult now at my age to tell a woman I'm a virgin and that I would need her guidance and experience to teach me. I'm no movie star or model and women don't turn their heads to look at me, but when a woman would go to bed with me the nerves and shakes and total lack of experience would leave me failing again.

I don't know if it sounds weird, but at my age now, living without sex, I kind of have a yearning that if I could lose my virginity even with a prostitute I would love to be taken by a strong lady. Someone that would take control  and assure me that she will look after me.

Am I special, or am I a freak? I'm inexperienced and scared to death of being in a bed with a woman. I could never perform to satisfy a woman of experience, and would start trembling again if the opportunity ever arose. I wondered in my dreams sometimes what it would be like to meet a lady that will take hold of me, knowing I'm a virgin, and comfort me holding me in her arms before taking me.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Were Dan Savage running this blog, this would be the point at which he advises the LW to consider paying a visit to an Economically Priced, Conveniently Located Sex Worker. If memory serves, such things are legal in New South Wales.

It might not be the most romantic option, Ant, but if you're not feeling up to going into the dating scene and finding the kind of assertive woman you want on your own, an EPCLSW could be a way to experience the intimacy you desire without the pressure of being judged by a partner. Also, it might be worth looking into Kara's suggestion of a therapist (sex or otherwise). I wouldn't use the word freak, but the fact that sex -- something that's supposed to be a fun activity for all parties involved -- leaves you "scared to death" probably isn't healthy.

And that bit about "I could never perform to satisfy a woman of experience" is awfully presumptuous. There are women out there who would be delighted to find and coach up a partner who hasn't acquired a lifetime of bad habits in bed. Talk to someone about your anxiety, and take heart in the fact that women are willing to date your non-movie-star self -- your situation is far from hopeless.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Don't jump into sex. Don't be afraid to take step two because you are afraid of step 50. Being in bed with a woman is a wonderful experience and best yet, doesn't require sex. Start the way kids do. Hold hands, hug, kiss on the cheek, then maybe some cuddling, kissing on the lips, etc. Each activity has it's own merits and rewards. Don't fear those activities because they can lead to sex. Move at your own pace and get comfortable with a woman you are attracted to.

If sex is stressful, don't have sex!]]></wp:comment_content>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I am a 19-year-old straight college student from California.

<strong>What is your definition of virginity?</strong>

I guess it's vaginal intercourse or anal. A dildo in the case of lesbians. Being "pure" seems completely different. If you do oral and whatnot you are no longer "pure." But I won't go into details with that.

<strong>Why have you chosen to remain a virgin?</strong>

First of all I have to say I have never been on a date. I assumed I was asexual until I met someone very special last year. He was in my Psychology class and we clicked right away. I was starting to get close to him right away. This is very rare for me. I thought about him every day. I had to hold back on what I told him because I am a very private person. I could not focus in my earlier class because I wanted to see him. I just loved him so much but I still had to protect myself. He liked me back and tried hanging out but I was vulnerable and I told him to get a girlfriend.

He did and I was heartbroken. I did not do this for no reason. I was so scared to say I had no experience. The other problem was I was not comfortable with any type of intimacy. I was molested when I was only 8. I told my mom but she looked at me and then went to go watch TV. I could not sleep after this event. I would ask her to help me but she would just hit me. I guess that was the event that that completely destroyed me.

I went to go see the school psychologist for 4 weeks and it helped me a lot. I don't think I will panic in such a way if an event like this happens again. Intimacy will probably be a big problem but I will take it slowly. For now I hope these feelings will not happen again because I feel that I don't want to deal with such a situation again. But if it does I will probably have to see the psychologist again but I'm okay with that. What my mother did will always stick with me.

I can't imagine falling in love like that again. I'm afraid the guy will go too fast and then cheat on me. I also don't want to tell him what happened to me when I was 8. That was also what I was afraid of saying to the guy I fell for last year. I guess I will have to wait it out and focus on my school.

I can't talk about how people have reacted to this because I don't go out and talk about it. People don't assume that because they apparently they think I'm pretty. I also am comfortable with talking about sex.

<strong>Anything else you want to say about virginity or our cultural attitudes towards it?</strong>

People make a big deal over nothing. Movies and TV make sex seem so casual. They make us think if we are over 18 and a virgin there is something wrong with us. That is totally wrong. There is nothing shameful about being a virgin. Even the male ones shouldn't be ashamed. I'm not embarrassed at all. I won't just randomly go out and tell everyone I'm a virgin. Unless it comes up.

For those who have suffered from sexual abuse I beg that you go to therapy. I have seen a huge change socially in myself. I used to be completely closed off and now I have learned to enjoy life. I will wait it out and see if I fall in love again. I'll have to wait and see. Even If I end up being a virgin at 30 it will be okay. Just as long as I'm truly ready.]]></content:encoded>

<span style="color: #660000; font-style: italic;"> </span>I personally feel beyond inspired to write and share my story and how losing my virginity (for a long while) made me an outcast in my culture, religion and even family. I didn't even tell anyone, nor did I take proper precautions to protect myself. Instead I carried a burden of self loathing and even thoughts of suicide for years before I "came out of the closet" as a de-virginized girl.

I almost responded to my "first time" as a rape, psychological yes, but as traumatic for a sheltered Mormon girl as it could be to someone in another culture.

I began thinking virginity was the only thing that could be kept intact to justify my existence. After that priceless "virtue" was lost I then used sex as a way to devulge my overwhelming feelings of self-hate. I began a slew of escapades to try to somehow prove to myself that I wasn't broken, but wanted, even as a sexual being.

Today, I have a stronger and more healthy perspective on what sex means to me.

I now know that even if I am sexually "active" (I hate that term) that I am not JUST a sex maniac. I am a woman, a girl, a compassionate individual who has stood trial for who I am more times than I can count. I still have to remind myself these things in the face of extreme conditions, ultimately discrimination within the Mormon church as I am living in Utah.

I am happy to share, and maybe someone like I was at 20 could find solace in my experiences. So they can know that they are not alone, and not worthless.]]></content:encoded>

<strong></strong>

<strong>Tell us about yourself: </strong>
I'm an eighteen year old, British art student.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>
To me, the entire concept of virginity is a bit silly; I don't think that people lose or gain anything when they 'do it' for the first time. I don't really understand why there is a vast moral gap between having a penis in your mouth and having a penis in your vagina, so I suppose that, for me, a person is no longer a virgin when you allow someone else to be a part of your sexuality.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>
I'm a virgin, and while I'm led to believe that virginity is coveted in some other cultures, in mine, as a teenager, it's seen as something shameful–people at school will call you 'tame', and openly wonder at your sexual orientation and your ability to 'get' a man. I've had boyfriends before, but because of Uni and friends and an intrinsic fear of being bored, none of those relationships have survived past the casual first stages. I'm not waiting for someone I love, I'm just waiting for someone who I feel that I COULD love, given the right chance and the right time, and who I'm sure feels the same way about me...as clichéd as it is, someone 'special'.

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I am 14 and live in UT. I like to think of myself as a feminist, despite nobody taking any of my opinions seriously. They tell me any stories I've heard from fellow feminists are just people "pulling my leg".

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Societal. It's nothing but a little flap of skin that means you've had sex, yet society has deemed it worthy of our time, so we make a huge fuss about it whenever we can. I define it as just an excuse to be able to hurt and control people. If you're a virgin, fine. If you aren't, fine.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

I'm a virgin. In part it's because sex doesn't interest me in the slightest, some because I have no clue what my sexuality is, and also because of social norms. I'm kind of afraid of sex because of slut-shaming, and I'm afraid people won't like me if I try it. I've also been taught that a man will find you disgusting and not want to have a relationship with you if you aren't a virgin, not by my mother, who doesn't want to talk about it, but by society and my friends. To tell the truth, I never thought about it much before this year, I always thought sex = evil = pregnant = death. I'm taking it to the extremes, but I kind of wanted to share my thoughts.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Not that I mean to cast aspersions on your friends and family, but that sounds like an awfully toxic atmosphere for a free-thinking feminist such as yourself. Hopefully you have people you can turn to -- be they in person or online -- other than those who clearly think so little of you.

And that bit about "a man will find you disgusting and not want to have a relationship with you if you aren’t a virgin?" Utter monkey muffins. You're well within your rights to hold off on sex, but whenever the time comes that you feel ready and willing to accept the inherent risks, I'll go out on a sturdy limb and say any partner worth having would find your confidence in yourself and your sexuality vastly more attractive and important than the aforementioned flap of skin. (And if I may channel Dan Savage for a moment, there are oh-so-many ways to be physically intimate with a partner that don't involve penis-in-vagina penetrative sex.)

Good on you, Senka, for being able to call out the slut-shaming BS and having the courage to think for yourself.]]></wp:comment_content>

I am a 23 year-old grad student at Concordia University in Montréal, Canada, doing a Masters in Drama Therapy. I consider myself an artist, a researcher, a scholar, and a student-therapist. Also, because of the body I was born with, I explode normative constructs of virginity.

When I was 17 I wasn't having periods and while experimenting sexually with my then-boyfriend I became really confused. I eventually found out the reason: I do not have a uterus or a vagina. In the medical profession this is called MRKH or Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser Syndrome (named after the four men who "discovered" it). This is a rare congenital condition where part of the reproductive system does not develop.

In terms of gender, I am a woman. Genetically, I have XY chromosomes. I have ovaries and hormones, which have produced secondary female characteristics, including breasts. My vulva and clitoris look and work the same way one expects them to, except I do not have a vaginal opening. While explaining it to a guy, I once compared this to "trying to put a penis in your armpit". It'll give a little, but ultimately will be impossible and if you forced it, it would hurt.

At first I was really upset because I still thought of myself as a "virgin" and suddenly realized I had nothing to "give away". I remember thinking, "I have gone as far as I can, and now what?" This part of my identity has forced me to find a new definition for a lot of cultural constructs, including sex.

I love sex. I find many forms of sex pleasurable in the context of a consenting and intimate relationship with another person. It's just that when I say "sex" it means something other than what most people think of as "sex". One of the challenging parts is having to discuss my situation with men because it requires them to challenge their assumptions and expectations as well. They have an image of "sex" that doesn't exactly correlate with how I think of it, which I sometimes forget until I am getting serious with someone and I have to take a "time out" to explain. Sure, it's awkward, but it also creates a dialogue about sex that I might not otherwise take the time to have.

I've come to think about my virginity as a period of my life prior to my first "sexual experiences." I fondly remember curiosity and self-exploration, but also anxiety and confusion. If I thought of "virginity" in terms of a physical state, then I never have been or ever will be a virgin. Now I think of it along a continuum of first experiences, from my first kiss, to my first time being touched or touching another person intimately, being naked with someone, first orgasm and sexual pleasure, and the feeling of having part of someone inside my body. I think it's a combination of first physical, emotional, and psychological experiences that over time have become part of my personal narrative.

I associate virgin with something I thought I had to be, but now I think the word "virgin" is just a way to make us think we're not supposed to be sexual beings. In contrast, I think of "first times" as the people, the moments, the feelings, and sensations. I could talk about how I missed out on having a "first time", but I would rather take it as an opportunity to talk about how my body helped me redefine "first time" to be what was meaningful for me.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself: </strong>
I'm a 24 year old college student from NYC.

<strong>How do you define virginity? </strong>
Virginity is something we all have in common, until one by one we all lose it.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>
I always wanted to have sex. At the age I am now, it's constantly on my mind, but I can't seem to find myself to do it. I break relationships and stay away from dating for the fear of becoming intimate.

I had plenty of opportunity to lose it, but I felt like this was something special and only a special person deserved it. As I got older it was harder to find someone to appreciate my feelings. Many men expect sex in a relationship at the beginning because they feel at my age I should be experienced. I feel that they should give me a chance and wait.

Now that I'm 24 and still a virgin, my morals have deserted me. I find myself lowering my expectations because I want to see what the big deal is really about. Yet, I can't seem to find someone worth losing it to.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I sympathize with what you're going through, Lola. I felt the same way before I lost my virginity.

This might be a really weird question (and please feel free to not answer it)...but how do you define a special person?

Could it happen with a good friend or are you waiting until you're in love with someone?

I ask because I know a few people who have turned a friend to a friend with benefits to alleviate sexual frustration.  Had I not met my current SO when I did I might have been one of them. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

I'm 24 too. I never found boys my age attractive when I was younger and was very focused on sports and other activities. Now that I'm dying to join in and know what it's all about I feel like I've missed the first half and am utterly trailing behind everyone else. 

I have no helpful advice for you. Just thought you'd like to know you're not alone!

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I am a 42 year-old virgin from Orange County California. I recently participated in a virgin panel on CBC Radio One's "The Current" [Note: We wrote about it <a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/2012/01/radio-segment-on-adult-virgins-is-an-antidote-to-reality-tv-shows-but-couldnt-they-have-booked-even-one-guest-who-wasnt-religious/" target="_blank">here</a>].

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

I define virginity as never having sexual intercourse.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

When I was a freshman in high school I was a total dork. I was skinny with bad acne and a bad haircut. Kids laughed at me, so I became a bookworm. I studied night and day and committed myself to school. This was in the go-go days of the mid 80’s, when the movie <em>Wall Street</em> came out. <em>Wall Street </em>got me hooked on the stock market. I was 14 years old and I was reading <em>The Wall Street Journal,</em> studying charts and graphs, and talking to people about equities, commodities and currencies. I figured if girls were going to reject me, then I was going to work for a big investment bank and make a fortune.

I was around seventeen when I first <em>really</em> <em>wanted </em>to have sex (or what most people refer to as "horny"). When I got out of college in 1992 I was still a virgin (and no job offers from the big investment houses).

By the end of the 90’s my career finally took off and I was making money. I was living in Texas in 1999 when I met a girl at the TGI Friday’s who liked me. She said she’d meet me at TGI’s the following night and we’d go from there. She stood me up, and at that point I just gave up. I was so angry that I boycotted women. Call it a "girlcott."

The next decade came and went, and when the economy tanked in 2008, I lost everything – my job, my career, my house, my company car, my 401(k). In the span of about 6 months I lost everything but my virginity.

Since then, I’ve picked up the pieces, but the damage is done. When my book came out I got some notoriety: people e-mailed me and called and said how nice it was that I was still "pure." Catholics took to this; older Catholic women are very traditional and they think it’s noble. Most of the e-mails I get these days are from mothers trying to set me up with their daughters, which is totally ridiculous. This isn’t what I wanted for my life–not exactly how I planned things.

They have no idea the pain and humiliation that goes with being a 42 year-old virgin. It stinks. I don’t want to be a virgin anymore. It’s not a good legacy. Not something to be proud of. Think about it: if I get hit by a bus tomorrow I’ll go down in history as the guy who couldn’t get laid. I don’t want to be remembered for that. I just want to find a girl, do it, and have a normal life. Maybe even fall in love and have a family.]]></content:encoded>

We'd love to run it in this blog.</span>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a 21-year-old American college student. Thanks to the internet, alcohol, and public transportation I've had a lot to write about concerning sex in my blog. Both my older sisters and my mother got pregnant in their teens, so I was raised to be wary about sex.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

I sometimes refer to those who have not had anal or vaginal penetrative intercourse as virgins. But there is a lot of gray area, and it gets defined differently by everyone. My last boyfriend and I had anal sex before we ever had vaginal sex, but he considered himself a virgin until the day his penis went into my vagina.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

I was 17 when I lost my virginity to a guy that I'd known for less than 24 hours. For a long time I had this idea that it would be "okay" to have sex once I was 18.

Eventually, thanks to Facebook I ended up with a boyfriend, 19 year old M1. We met up and I had a great time so when he asked me to be his girlfriend I said yes. We made out a lot and he couldn't keep his hands off of my breasts, even in front of his friends. He kept pressuring me to have sex two weeks into the relationship. I didn't actually like him that much, but he took me out to hang with his friends who smoked weed and had tattoos, so I just told him I wanted to wait a little longer.

He had a party where I met a friend of his with the same name, M2. He asked me to hang out the next day, a Sunday. M2 was 19 but didn't have a car, so he came by on his bicycle. I rode on the back and he pedaled us to his house in the next town over. He made me the best scrambled eggs I've ever had in my life, then we watched TV in his room. He was talking to another girl on his computer when suddenly he stopped and looked at me. "You want to kiss me, don't you?" I nodded yes, and next thing I knew we were making out and he asked me if I wanted to have sex.

I told him I needed to think about it and laid next to him in silence for about five minutes before saying yes. I had decided that it wasn't a big deal and I liked this guy enough that I wouldn't regret it. I got on top, lowered myself slowly, and it didn't hurt too bad. I remember saying, "I heard it hurt the first time but damn!" It was fun, and M2 helped me figure out how to break up with M1. I did it the next day. I stayed with M2 for about three weeks. We had sex pretty much every time we were together. He claimed to not be interested in oral or anal sex. It often lasted hours...though I never had an orgasm with him.

Then M2 went away to visit a friend who was in college four hours away. I sneaked out of my window to say goodbye to him at the train station. When he got back, I called to ask about his trip and he asked who I was. When I told him my name he asked if he could call me back. He didn't call back two hours later; I sent him a text message saying it was over.

Since then I've had a lot of sexual adventures. I don't regret any of it; I've turned into a very sex positive, self-confident person. It took a while but I think it would have taken even longer had I waited.

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?</strong>

Our society treats the concept of virginity as a measure of value. Both women and men are hurt by the pressures to either be sexual or remain "pure." It does no one any good when we glorify sex and virginity in such an unrealistic fashion while refusing to educate youth with real facts.

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I am a 26 year old virgin lesbian living in Illinois suburbia. I'm single and have never been in a relationship. Due to a failed art degree I have been living with my parents while struggling to find a way to be on my own.

Despite being Hispanic American, my family is heavily assimilated and religion is not enforced in the household. My parents want me and my siblings to simply be good people. Virginity is neither discussed nor frowned down upon and I assume that my parents know that if there is sexual activity then it is responsible. And it just never happened for me. I never met the right person and I'm closer to being 30 than I am 20.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

As a gay woman, I consider virginity as the lack of sexual experience. When two people interact sexually and go beyond kissing and groping into more deeper activities then they are no longer virgins.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

All throughout high school, college and post graduation I just never came across another lesbian. The ones I did were already in relationships. Therefore, I am absolutely untouched. And there is NO question about my orientation, I knew I was different ever since I was little. I can acknowledge that a man is attractive, but I feel nothing for them.

But sex is everywhere and everyone is having it. My friend, who used to be a male prostitute and who engages in one night stands tells me that I overestimate how much people have sex and every time those words play in my head I want to scream.

Another "best" friend of 15 years (straight female) claimed she was a virgin up until last year when she admitted that not only is she extremely sexually promiscuous but she lost her virginity to a married man. I thought she was a good liar until I realized that the only reason that I believed that she was still a virgin was because I still am...I guess it's more of a matter of "what's wrong with me?" Especially when from my point of view, a lot of women who identify as heterosexual engage in no-strings attached sexual escapades with other women. It feels like a slap in the face to me.

The kicker? Men hit on me a lot. But as I said before, I'm just not interested.

I just feel so isolated and alone in this and I don't think anyone who has been sexually active will ever understand me. I can't even admit that I'm a virgin to my therapist, the thought alone makes me cry non-stop. At this point, I don't even know if it's about "sex" anymore. But the media and my friends don't help.

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?</strong>

It's very much stigmatized, ridiculed and it makes me ashamed of myself. There is the saying "It Get's Better" I'm starting to think it never will.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Elizabeth,

Thank you for sharing your story. There are so many elements I recognise from my own experiences. Interestingly enough, it always feels as if all the world is engaged in sexual activities, while in fact that might just be the result of my own experiences. Your friend is probably right, and things might not be as we think they are. After all, it's an intimate and largely hidden world ;) I hope you'll find someone who makes you feel at home, or maybe you already have since you've posted this message. I too hope to find someone special some day soon. Boy or girl, I'm not sure yet and I don't mind either. The biggest problem for me is probably the part in which I have to open up to others. I don't easily communicate with everyone and that's what makes it a challenge for me. I hope to feel less alone and isolated once I've learned to do so. I imagine you to be a wonderful girl, so take your time, discover the world and find someone special! Love, Stephanie (24)]]></wp:comment_content>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm an 18 year old straight, cis female college student from New York. My absolute favorite thing to do is read, I laugh easily and often, and I love animals. I can talk for hours about feminism, movies, Doctor Who, or history. I make awesome brownies and cupcakes. Oh, and I'm a rape survivor.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Virginity is a social construct put in place to shame women, I've found. It's also cis- and hetero-normative.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

By society's standards, I had my virginity "taken" from me at 15, by someone much older who used physical and emotional abuse to his advantage. I spent years hating myself and blaming myself for what had happened, as well as being thoroughly ashamed. I spiraled into depression and pushed everyone away. Now I feel that I've become stronger and want to try and help other people who have experienced rape or other abuse.

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?</strong>

I think that if someone wants to wait until they're married for p-in-v sex, that's their own choice. If someone doesn't, or they only want to do oral, or anal, or nothing at all, we should respect them. As a society, we should value people for who they are, not by their sexual decisions.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>
I'm a 25 year old male virgin living in Maryland. I'm about to finish my Masters Degree and find myself at a bit of a crossroads in life, including the subject of my virginity.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>
I'm of the belief that it's the first penis and vagina experience. Sure there are a wide variety of sexual activities, but from the stories I've heard I think it's the first time that really changes people.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>
I've discovered that being an older virgin can result in some tricky relationships, especially if both people involved are older virgins. It's like the elephant in the room–you pretend it's not there, but you cannot ignore it.

For the longest time I never considered it "wrong" to be a virgin. I don't have STDs nor religious reasons for waiting, I just felt that getting good grades and figuring out my career path was more important than getting laid. This mentality lasted me through most of my undergraduate years until I gradually realized that, at the age of 22, I was well above the "average age" of losing virginity. This didn't bother me–my only requirement for sex is that it should be within a committed relationship (that doesn't necessarily mean marriage). Basically, no one-night stands for me.

I have been in two relationships so far both with virgin women in their early 20s who wanted to wait. The first wanted to wait until marriage for religious reasons. The second one was more complicated. She claimed being self-conscious and scared, but after the breakup it occurred to me that she never gave me an honest answer for waiting. An interesting mystery of virginity I fear I'll never solve.

In both cases, I was the one that got dumped. They read me the typical riot act of things girls usually tell guys they want to break up with starting with "I think we should just be friends," and ending with "It's the hardest decision I've ever made but I hope one day you'll agree that this is for the best."

Although I think the things they both told me were true, I wonder if *my* status as a virgin was a significant factor in the breakup. I should note that I never pressed the issue of sex in either relationship. In both cases I was wiling to wait until they were ready because I was looking for a committed relationship, not sex (though I'd have been willing to engage in it). Yet despite my sincerity to wait, I think they were afraid of hurting me. They didn't believe someone can be so selfless when it comes to sex.

In both cases the words "you deserve better than me" was said by the woman (which secretly pissed me off A LOT, that a woman would put herself down like that) Although both clarified that statement as saying our interests were growing apart, I'm beginning to think they were really saying "you deserve someone that shares your interests AND wants sex."

I am a virgin, and I'm not afraid to admit it. Yet despite my growing older, and these two failed relationships, I am still willing to wait if a future girlfriend wishes it. If that should happen again then, maybe, just maybe she'll recognize my sincerity.]]></content:encoded>

<div><strong>Tell us about yourself:  </strong></div>
<div><strong></strong>I'm a twenty-nine year old guy in California and a hard-working physician, I'm also a big sports fan who loves to read, travel and explore. I'm passionate about life but also insecure in it.</div>
<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Never having had sexual intercourse.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

I didn’t expect to find myself here, still a virgin as I approach my 30th birthday. In a culture that has created the expectation that men are the initiators of sex, I admit that reaching thirty without having so much as a relationship, has been frustrating. Never kissed a girl, never even been on a date.

Maybe it’s in part my own doing. Despite numerous crushes, I’ve always been a shy, insecure guy, whose fear of rejection has always trumped my ability to pursue them. Of course, I always rationalized it and found excuses: prioritizing schoolwork in college and now my job, "I don’t have time to invest in a relationship." In hindsight, I’ve just been too scared to put myself out there.

Despite a high sex drive and desire to lose my virginity, I’m still faced by that fear of failure, and now, fear of inexperience. So instead, I’ve played it safe, turning to porn and masturbation. That’s been satisfying to a point, but as I reach a new milestone in my life, it’s caused me to pause.

Losing my virginity won’t be everything. Intellectually, I know that. But my suspicion is that sex is something I want, value and think a lot about, so having sex will not only feel good, but will also affirm my masculinity and self-esteem. That’s a lot to ask, I realize, especially from someone who’s never had a first date. But still, a guy can fantasize about how he’d feel, can’t he?

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm 24, I live in California. I always supported women's sexual rights, but I didn't get really into feminist activism until I read Jessica Valenti's "Purity Myth." I think that was my real "click" moment. Since then I have been getting into groups, blogs and reading all kinds of books by great feminist authors.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Going from a state of not having had sex to a state of having sex. I really don't believe very much in "virginity" as a real thing. I didn't give it away or lose it. The first person I had sex with isn't walking around with it in his pocket. He's not keeping it in his sock drawer, and I'm not going to find it in the couch cushions with the lose change and lint. I don't feel any part of me was taken, and I don't feel that I'm missing anything either. My (soon-to-be) husband doesn't see me as damaged or used. I'm just me. Only thing that's different is I've had sex when previously, I hadn't.

<strong> Tell us your story</strong>

The first time I had it...I didn't expect it to hurt as much as it did. Holy CRAP was it excruciatingly painful. My boyfriend at the time wasn't trying to hurt me, he wasn't forcing it, he was actually going really slowly and carefully. It just hurt like a <em>mofo</em>. I'd heard from only one person that it would be painful. No one but she had ever mentioned the possibility of pain. So when I experienced it, I was well...shocked to put it mildly. Wasn't ready for that.

I have no idea how long the experience lasted. The pain was a little too distracting to pay attention to the time. But eventually, when he got it all the way inside me, that was it. We didn't move. Just sat there with him inside and me trying not to make the pain any worse. We tried to thrust it maybe once, but it just wasn't happening. Hurt too much. In the end we just decided that it would be best for him to slowly pull back out. I don't remember if that hurt less or more than putting it in.

It took at least until the 5th time for it to stop hurting.

The first time was not magical. There was no passionate love-making or epic, orgasmic breathing and sweating. There was pain, however unintentional. I think that's something that our culture tends to gloss over. There is so much in media, video games, books, etc. that tells us that the first time is this amazing experience with fireworks and screaming orgasms and romantic declarations akin to harlequin novel character quips. And it all takes place on silk sheets with sexy underwear and clothes strewn on the floor in sexual passion.

Nah. For some of us, it just hurts a lot.]]></content:encoded>

If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong></span><span style="color: #660000; font-style: italic;">. We'd love to run it in this blog.</span>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

My name is Alexandra and I'm a (newly) 20 year old university student from Australia. I love traveling, and the thought of setting off into the great unknown with nothing but unbridled exhilaration and a backpack. I am agnostic. I have never had a boyfriend. I am a virgin.

<strong> How do you define virginity?</strong>

In keeping with the ideas of the society in which I have grown up, I would define "virginity", in a traditional sense, as penetrative (penis-in-vagina) sex. Where I live, having had sexual experience other than penetrative sex is pretty much seen as redundant if you haven't actually "done the deed". Most girls - and guys - I know probably lost their virginity at around the age of 16/17. To be any older and a virgin is seen as atypical and "weird".

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

Until two years ago, I had never really considered my virginity, or the fact that I'd had no sexual experience other than making-out. It just hadn't bothered me. But then I turned 18 and it became a "thing", and suddenly EVERYONE had done it except for me.

Being a 20 year old who has not engaged in penetrative sex is, for me, a source of shame. I think about it constantly. I am terrified people will find out. Although I have given and received oral sex, been fingered by a guy and have generally been in touch with my own sexuality since a young age, I still feel terribly inexperienced. It's become a cycle - I'm too scared to go further with guys for fear they will realise I'm a virgin and be disgusted. It makes me feel like a freak; different from my friends, inexperienced, like a child. Especially seeing as last year I traveled Europe and STILL managed to return, to the disappointment of my friends, chaste.

I never wanted to be an older virgin, and I have had opportunities to lose it, but these were casual sex situations with people I'd only just met. I'm a deeply emotional person (with extremely low self confidence at times) and feel like I need to be with someone who I've at least met more than once. I'm getting to the stage now though that I don't really care who I lose it with/to, especially after finding out that my sister (younger by 3 years) just lost hers.

The thing that bothers me most about being a virgin is the stigma that is attached to it (specifically where I live), and how this serves to reinforce individual insecurities. To me, finding and falling in love is something I want and care about SO much more. I wish I could feel liberated by my difference; instead I feel oppressed.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself: </strong>

I am 25, and live in Virginia. I went to college, moved abroad to teach English in France, moved back, and have traveled on four continents.  I am currently underemployed and not in a relationship, although there are a few possibilities for that on the horizon.  I move a lot trying to find a good job.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Sexual contact with someone else's genitals...that kind of intimacy/loss of "innocence".  I think that if you've had oral sex, you aren't a virgin. But of course there are lots of kinds of virginity. Intercourse might be another "virginity level" to attain.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

I waited.  I wanted to be in a relationship when I first had sex... but then I didn't seek out any relationships. When I was 12 my older sister had a baby at age 17, so I was also pretty terrified of pregnancy and STDs for a while.  I was focused on work and school and just didn't put myself out there.  I was also suffering from poor body image, and just internalized way too many messages from the media/my family that I was the "plain sister." Both my sisters were married young, I think my little sister even got pregnant before I even first had sex.

I usually told people the truth when playing "never have I ever" or when sex came up.  Towards that last year though, I had one friend I had to lie to, she just wouldn't stop asking about it, I just invented a story around a guy I had actually gone on one date with.  And I even implied to my mother that I'd had sex when she tried to tell me guys wouldn't be into me if I didn't shave my armpits on the regular.

But then, last year, almost exactly a year ago, I was sick of waiting.  I didn't want anything to be awkward with future dates.  I went out to a bar with a friend, and let myself get picked up by a, in retrospect, horrible guy.  He was in town on business: ideal, never see him again! It was awesome in that respect, just what in the end I needed. I didn't tell him, I just got it done.  The bubble bath I took when I get home was better!

After that though, I felt more confident to throw myself on the dating market.  I dated a coworker, slept with the friend of a friend, and dated online.  I had a "friends with more" situation with someone for 8 months and it was awesome. It wasn't until I met him that I had my first orgasms (including multiples! OMG)  and learned how to really masturbate and get myself off.  It's been a great year.

It can be weird to be a late bloomer, because despite my late virginity, I have a very high sex drive and love talking about sex.  It can be so much fun, but its a difficult line to walk, TMI with your friends or not.

I think in the end, just do what feels right for you.  I don't regret waiting until I was 24.  I might slightly regret the anonymous nature of my first encounter, but honestly waiting until I was older to have sex, I had so many more interpersonal and communication skills that made everything so much easier and more fulfilling.

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>  I'm a 24-year-old heterosexual female living in the US.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

I’m currently rethinking how I define virginity. I used to think the loss of virginity was a clear milestone for heterosexual females like myself-- the first time one willingly engages in penetrative vaginal sex-- but now it doesn’t seem so simple. As someone who made the deliberate decision to have vaginal sex but was physically unable to do so, I don’t know whether or not to call myself a virgin or not. Which matters more, the intention or the act itself?

It also seems a little ridiculous to claim the label "virgin" when I have an active sex life of oral and outercourse and orgasm more frequently than some of my friends who lost their vaginal virginity years ago, but the cultural significance of vaginal virginity is pervasive and hard to just throw away or ignore, especially when it's the standard by which so many other people define it.

I often say I'm in "Virgin Limbo"; I don’t feel right identifying as a virgin OR not a virgin. I think the definition of virginity needs tweaking to account for situations like this.

<strong> Tell us your story</strong>

Until I was 22 I was a virgin because I was waiting for the right person. My first kiss was at 18 and my first boyfriend at 19, but in college I never dated anyone long enough to feel the comfort and trust I considered a prerequisite. However, just shy of my 22nd birthday, I met him. We had been dating a few months when I decided that our relationship-- and, most importantly, I personally!-- was ready.

The night leading up to it was perfect. There was a rooftop sunset, spontaneous fireworks display in the distance, and making out in the rain; if it had been in a movie, you'd have rolled your eyes at how "unrealistic" it was. We went back to his room with some condoms and went for it.

Except . . . "it" didn't happen. I was more than ready when he tried to enter me, but it felt like he was like he was trying to thrust against a wall-- a wall that felt sharp stabs of pain every time it was hit! I normally have a very high tolerance for pain, so I couldn't believe this was supposedly what every girl feels her first time, especially since he hadn’t even entered me more than a half-inch. I tried loosening things up more with more lube and orgasming first but it didn’t make a difference. I was so frustrated I was ready to force through the pain, but my partner had been with a virgin before and knew it wasn't supposed to be so difficult or painful, so we stopped.

In the following months we sought advice from trusted friends and the Internet alike and were given suggestions from extra lube to getting drunk. But the only thing that actually helped was a name we discovered: vaginismus, a condition in which the pubococcygeus (PC) muscles at the opening of the vagina involuntarily close and painfully resist the entry of foreign objects, from tampons to penises. It explained everything: why I'd always hated using tampons, why I'd cried in pain during my one and only pelvic exam, and why I couldn't have sex. I wasn’t "unusually tight" as I’d once believed; penetration objectively hurt me in ways it doesn’t hurt most people, thanks to muscle spasms I can't control. It’s still a mystery why I have vaginismus, but knowing what it is has lead to information on how to fix it.

Fast forward two years later. I'm still with the same partner and thanks to open minds and a few compatible kinks our sex life is plenty satisfying, but vaginal sex is still a distant dream. I've seen a doctor and gotten advice on relaxation techniques, Kegel exercises, vaginal dilation, and insight on what muscles to move and how, but while things seem to be progressing, it’s slow-going. It’s frustrating that what is so natural and pleasurable for most people is painful and a chore for me, something I have to "work on" in an unsexy clinical way. There’s enough promise in what we have achieved that we haven’t given up and eagerly await the day we can have vaginal sex, but for now, I’m still stuck in "Virgin Limbo."

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm an 18 year old student studying psychology at Northern Arizona University.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

I believe virginity is just the first time you experience sexual closeness with another person. Virginity is kind of sexual ignorance (not in a disrespectful way, just in a 'there's no way to know unless you do it' way).

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

I am a virgin. My friends have been teasing me since I was 14 about my virginity. I've always been the virgin and I honestly don't think that will change any time soon. My mom was very open with me when she was teaching me about sex. She never said it was a shameful act. She just said that I should wait to have sex until I feel completely comfortable with myself and my partner.

I am very comfortable with my body. I masturbate regularly and am educated about sex and safety. My comfort is not the reason I haven't had sex yet though. I am still a virgin simply because I have never felt comfortable around anyone to let them that close to me. I'm not ashamed of my sexuality. No doubt, I'd love to have sex one day, but I'm just not ready right now. And there's nothing wrong with that.

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm an 18 year old virgin college freshman from New York.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Honestly? I don't really know. For me personally, I'll lose my virginity when I am in a relationship and have vaginal intercourse with a man, which I think is pretty much the standard view. But I know virginity doesn't really exist in a solid way, and think that each person defines virginity differently, because they define sex differently. Virginity is going to be important for a very, very long time (sadly) but I think that each person owns their virginity individually, and can therefore decide for themselves what it means.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

I went to a week-long Bible Camp for several years, and one of the biggest messages of the week was always about virginity. From the time I was ten or eleven, they started talking to us about virginity, and how important it is to keep it for marriage. They told us we would be broken messes if we ever had sex before  marriage. That no one would want us. Of course this was directed mainly at the girls. They cited passages about marriage being when a man "cleaves" into his woman, which sounded kind of terrifying, because all I could think of was meat cleavers. The whole thing was a huge festival of slut-shaming and misogyny, but at the time I had no idea what either of those things even were. Unfortunately, I bought into this completely. I bought a purity ring, which I wore proudly for years. I had a holier-than-thou attitude when my friends started having sex. I don't know exactly what made me so susceptible to this whole thing, except that for some complicated reasons, I was scared of sex from a fairly early age, even before the camp. Then, through the messages from the camp, I become entirely terrified of sex. In addition, I was never the prettiest girl, and because of this, I felt that I couldn't afford to be "dirtied" by having pre-marital sex, because I didn't have enough going for me for anyone to ever really want me if I wasn't pure and whole.

Oddly enough, throughout all of this, I had sexual desires that I never even really tried to repress. I was accepting of it, and dealt with them myself. Somehow that never seemed wrong to me, thankfully, and I think it helped foster a comfort with my body and my sexuality that many girls who go through what I went through (and even those who don't have these experiences) don't discover. But this also made me wonder - how was I ever really going to wait until marriage to experience this thing, this be-all and end-all of worthiness and virtue which everyone was so obsessed with?

Eventually, I started to realize that my mother (who had reacted with horror when I proudly announced my abstinence pledge–she had no idea that the camp was as extreme as it was and I think she felt terribly guilty about it afterwards) was right– none of this was reality-based. Though I didn't call myself a feminist until spring of my senior year in high school, I think I've been one for my entire life, because my viewpoints haven't changed so much as they have been validated by the "feminist" title. I always believed in female independence and autonomy, and wanted to be a strong woman who could take care of herself without anyone’s help.

Also, due to having divorced parents, I was always kind of scared of marriage in the first place. So when my counselor one summer, a girl who was barely over 20, started telling me she was going to get married as "as soon as God drops the right man in [her] lap," I was entirely horrified. But it made me realize something huge: one of the things that the abstinence movement doesn't tell you is that it's not that difficult to wait - because you're not supposed to be waiting that long. You're supposed to be getting married and starting a family as soon as possible. There I was, thinking I was going to have to wait until my late twenties at the earliest to have sex, because I never wanted to get married young, and wondering how in the hell I was going to handle all that sexual frustration, and wondering how all these other people dealt with it, when suddenly I realized that they didn’t deal with it – they just got hitched right away. It changed everything for me.

Two months later, the ring was off. I didn’t suddenly start having some wild sex life – I am still, much to my chagrin, a virgin in (almost?) every sense of the word – but I did realize that I really, really did not have to wait for marriage to have sex. I realized how ridiculous that was, and how terrifyingly cult-like the camp had really been. I have a much healthier relationship with my sexuality these days, and though I still have some residual issues left from what I essentially view as the traumatizing experience of the camp, I know that when I enter into a healthy relationship where I feel safe and comfortable, I will be more than ready to lose my virginity without much fanfare. And I look forward to it each and every day.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm an 18 year-old girl living in Texas, hoping to study art and theater in college, or maybe gender studies then law school, or maybe creative writing. Who knows?

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

"Virginity" is such an outdated concept. The accepted definition intrinsically leaves out those whose sexual identities cannot be pinned down by "penetration." For many, other forms of sexual intimacy are in fact more intimate than intercourse itself, and many individuals may never experience the kind of "sex" that most of us have internalized as "real sex." Does that mean they are virgins? I'd certainly hope to see the thoughts on this and viewpoints of those other than cis-sexual individuals discussed in such a public forum as this film. Exposure and discussion can hopefully push for not only the acceptance of but active inclusion of trans individuals.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

I lost my "virginity" to my boyfriend about two months ago. Honestly, I wish I had done it sooner! Oral sex doesn't seem to be my thing, and ever since we've started having penetrative intercourse I feel way more comfortable sexually with him.

For most of my teenage years I felt really ashamed of being a virgin, thinking that I'd have sex at the soonest possible opportunity. Yet when I had the chance with one boyfriend, I didn't, and I ended up breaking up with him. Even when I started out with my current boyfriend, I was torn between the shame of having everyone at school know I was a virgin (I thought I was so lame) and having sex with my boyfriend when I wasn't particularly anxious to. Now I realize, "virginity" really doesn't matter. Other people's opinions don't matter either. I don't feet sexually liberated because I've had sex, I feel sexually liberated because I'm happy with my sexuality and my relationship, and I realize that this contentedness is a beautiful feeling that more people deserve to feel.]]></content:encoded>

We'd love to run it in this blog. </span>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm 21 now but my story is about when I was 15. I am a female and I live in Arizona.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

To be a virgin doesn't mean you're pure. Girls think its okay to give blowjobs and make out with everyone they now and still be considered pure. Your virginity is just a weird thing that people took and reformatted the meaning. Being a virgin just means you haven't had penetrative sex.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

When I was 15 I had known this guy for about 6 years. I always thought he was so hot and he NEVER liked me back until I was 15. I had gotten my braces off, grown out my hair and got curves; too bad I moved off to another city in Arizona huh? Well I would go back down and visit a lot and we started, yah know, "talking." So we were planning on having sex and him taking my virginity. I was super insecure of my body so I was anxious about it. But the night it had came down to it..I was fine. It was uncomfortable though and the guy honestly didn't care. He turned me around at like 4am to do it AGAIN and I did.

So the day after I was all excited and stuff and wanted to do it again but when I got home and after a few weeks I realized what a huge mistake I made. I literally feel like throwing up thinking about it and how gross it was seeing him make weird noises and talk dirty which I hated. I often get random glimpses of thoughts of the actual sex. I hate him so much now the thought of him grosses me out and I'm never comfortable around guys now.

I am emotionally scared. I literally hate him so much I hope he dies. Just talking about it makes me want to throw up and die myself. I clearly wasn't ready. DON'T LET GUYS PRESSURE YOU TO HAVE SEX. Trust me honey, they are just playing you, they just want what's in your pants and that's it. If you chose to have sex do it with a boyfriend. Trust me you won't be as fucked up as I am now.]]></content:encoded>

I always thought of the loss of virginity as vaginal penetration.  In reality, though, I don't see losing your virginity as an all-or-nothing thing.  There are different stages of sexual activity, and it's just my personal preference to put the virginity line there.

When I was younger, I didn't really want to have sex until I was in a relationship.  As I got older, I decided to at least wait until I get to know someone first.  Now, I'd have sex with a cute stranger if I wasn't worried about disease.<br /><br />But all of this is moot, because I've never really had the opportunity to have sex.  I've always been shy and withdrawn, and when I hit puberty I developed a serious case of depression and social anxiety.  This turned normal teenage relationship angst into a terrifying feeling of paralysis.  And it was at its worst during high school and college, when most people are starting to begin their sex lives.<br /><br />I don't think I'm unattractive, but I'm also not particularly attractive.  I was a skinny nerd in school and never really did anything to draw attention to myself.  I asked a couple girls out in high school, and they said "Yes" but didn't mean it.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">How have your dates/partners reacted?</span>It wasn't until my second year of college that I had a sexual experience at all. I was studying in England and became friends with a cute girl named Anna.  I noticed that she seemed to pay more than friendly attention to me, and I was mutually interested.  I was too terrified to act, so she took the initiative and for my last two weeks in England, we slept together a few times.  We didn't have intercourse, and I'm still not sure exactly why -- except that I wouldn't do it without a condom, and I didn't have one.<br /><br />Going out and getting a condom would have seemed a natural solution, but I guess it just never occurred to me.  As it was, I was thrilled with what was happening.  My self-esteem experienced a surge from her.  That, and she had a special talent for fellatio.  I can't speak from experience, naturally, but I think I actually had multiple orgasms.  I certainly had two back-to-back that I will remember until the day I die.<br /><br />That's how it went.  She went down on me, I went down on her.  I tried to be especially attentive during oral sex, but then I guess most insecure guys are. It became obvious that she was just having fun, but I actually liked her.  We were both American students in England, but when school started back, we'd be back together in the same city.  I realized that she wasn't really interested in pursuing it.  And she wasn't.<br /><br />Since then, I've gone out on dates with four or five girls, but none of them have ever turned into anything.  The closest I came to sex since then was one night I spent with a girl named Sarah.  She stayed at my place and wanted to have sex, but she was having her period.  A few months after that, I starting seeing a girl named Jen, but she had just gotten out of a relationship and didn't want any commitment at all beyond making out on my couch.  She never really broke up with me; she just stopped calling, didn't return my messages, and I got the point.<br /><br />Now I'm 28 and worried desperately that the clock is ticking for me.  I know that people can have sex after 30, but I don't like my odds.  I'm not in great shape, my social anxiety still keeps me from talking to people, and I'm going bald.  I'm also insecure and desperate, and neither of things are considered turn-ons.  It's funny, because I'm not insecure sexually, really; just the fact that I'm so inexperienced.  I'm not hugely well-endowed, but I'm well above-average.  My stamina seemed fine during oral sex, and I think I'm at least somewhat good at it myself, or else that girl Anna was a good actress.  It's just the simple inter-personal things that you do to build a relationship -- or just to get laid -- that I can't master.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Anything else you want to say about virginity or our cultural attitudes towards it?</span>There is just so much SEX out there in the world and so many ways to remind you that you're not having it.  The perception is that everyone ELSE is doing it.  It's a false perception, but it's still pretty convincing if you're insecure.<br /><br />I dare not tell anyone that I'm still a virgin.  Most people assume I'm not, since I'm freakin' 27, and if the topic does come up, I say that I did it once.  But the worst thing is admitting it to myself.  Because logically, I know that other people aren't judging me nearly as much as I judge myself.  And that lack of confidence has a cyclical effect, decreasing my attractiveness and becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.<br /><br />I'm sure things aren't as bad for me as they seem.  All of my female friends assure me that I'm going to find someone someday (although that's just half a sentence; the other half is "but it won't be me").  But the fact that I've had such poor luck with women -- and been treated poorly even by those who didn't turn me down -- just makes me wonder if I won't end up as a 50-year-old "confirmed bachelor" who teaches literature at a small private school and then goes home and cries into his Chardonnay.<br /><br />But thanks for the website; it's nice for us virgins to have somebody else to hear from.  And it's good to know that there are more of us out there than Madison Avenue would have us believe.  And maybe someday being a nerdy, but loving guy will be the new fashion.  Or maybe there's a bigger touch of handsomeness in me than I could ever admit.  But I'm tired of holding my breath.  I'm hoping for the world to change.  Hope along with me, won't you?<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Tell us how you define virginity, how you lost/kept it, and anything else about the v-word.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[aaggh I lost my comment!  so will make this briefer.  Don&#39;t feel bad about being a virgin at an older age, yes it&#39;s a pity you have missed out on the joys of sex so far, but think of it this way you still have a wonderful mystery to find out about, whilst the rest of us can be somewhat jaded and have forgotten what that&#39;s like.  Yes some women may be surprised that you are a virgin but honestly I had a boyfriend who was a virgin and I was thrilled to be the first person he experienced sex with.  Not that it would have mattered to me whether he had experience or not before but it was lovely knowing that I helped show him the ropes.  And yes he wasn&#39;t too good at first but that was okay because even if physically it wasn&#39;t the best experience for me emotionally it was very fulfilling and I&#39;ve never forgotten it.  Also within a short time he was very good!  In fact he is the only guy that has ever managed to give me an orgasm, up till I met him I thought there was something wrong with me, now I know it&#39;s just the guys who are doing the wrong thing.  So I&#39;m grateful I met him because I would think it was me with the problem.  It just goes to show that years of experience don&#39;t always matter.  Please believe in yourself some lady will be thrilled to show the ropes I know I would.  You&#39;ve got a wonderful experience to find out about don&#39;t do anything drastic.  By the way I too was older than all my friends before I lost my virginity so I understand what you are going through, but my first boyfriend (though he could never make me come) was really gentle with me so it was great.  You have so many good experiences go out and live life and hopefully some wonderful lady will come your way.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[my second sexual relationship was with a boyfriend who was a virgin, and I think I was more nervous that time than my first time probably because he was quite nervous so I was glad I wasn&#39;t a virgin too because I think that would have made me even more nervous but having said that I can understand what you mean about it being a bonding experience if you were both virgins but personally I&#39;m glad my first sexual experience was with a guy who wasn&#39;t a virgin and when I did have a virgin boyfriend I wasn&#39;t a virgin, simply because it helps to have someone who is more experienced to guide whoever is the virgin, it&#39;s not about the person&#39;s sexual prowess just more about having a calmer person guiding the nervous person.  As far as being inept the first time don&#39;t worry about that because if you care about someone the emotional bond is there when you first have sex with them it feels really special emotionally, the physical pleasure comes later, my virgin boyfriend came straight away so obviously it wasn&#39;t physically great for me but emotionally it was lovely he held me all night after that, and strangely enough within a short time he turned into a good lover the only man I&#39;ve been with actually who has managed to give me an orgasm but then I haven&#39;t been with a lot of guys. I wouldn&#39;t have cared if he was a virgin or not but it did feel really special knowing I was his first, and yes he wasn&#39;t a young guy either he was in his late 20s.  Whatever way it works out for you whether you are both virgins or not I&#39;m sure if you do it with someone you care about it it will be special.]]></wp:comment_content>

This story came through our comments and we thought we'd share it with you.</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">I'm a 53 year old male virgin. </span>Many factors lead me to this state of celibacy. I'm Catholic, I never had a car or real dating money until my early 30s, my parents NEVER encouraged dating or relationships for me or my siblings (6 of us in all), no girls ever showed any interest in me, I was shy, and to some extent my family was dysfunctional and emotionally barren.<br /><br />I've had 5 dates in my life, and all of them were a waste of time. They were emotionally traumatizing since I started so late, I had no clue as to how to behave. None of the people I ever wanted to see again.<br /><br />Being celibate is not the WORST thing that can happen to you. In my case I developed a mild porno addiction and used masturbation since 15 to satisfy my lustful feelings. Today most of that is gone. I find most women simply don't like men today. Once you get past 30-35, if you are still single, it was probably what God intended for you.<br /><br />Sadly some of us just won't get any offers for intimacy and we may also lack the skills to get anyone interested in us as well. Read the book Save the Males. I learned to accept what happened to me, and I'm glad I'm not stuck with kids I didn't want or a marriage I don't enjoy. Many married people have told me repeatedly I'm lucky to be single and not to change it now.<br /><br />I'll never know until death it this was God wanted for me or not. It's happened, and all I can do is deal with it one day at a time. There is no fairness in the dating world, and lots of fine people just won't land a partner. Drop the self-pity and shame trip–it's done.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Tell us how you define virginity, how you lost/kept it, and anything else about the v-word.

She talks to us about her Mexican household, being 'flamboyant' and why art classes can be awkward.  Please send us an <a href="mailto:info@trixiefilms.com">email</a> if you'd like to tell your story. </span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is your definition of virginity?</span><br />I think that virginity is more of a state of mind. I know a couple of girls who do everything BUT sexual intercourse in order to technically remain virgins. I can sadly understand why they do this. I grew up in a Mexican household were I was given a lot of mixed messages on the issue of virginity. My dad was pretty open minded. My mom, on the other hand, pretended to be open about it (she would tell me I was free to have sex) but labeled girls who lost their virginity before marriage as "whores."<br /><br />That certainly has contributed to the confused state of mind I now have. A part of me wants to remain a virgin until I get marry while the other simply doesn’t. Nevertheless, I am conscious that virginity does not define nor does it make a woman any better.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why have you decided to stay a virgin?</span><br />Well, I never officially decided to remain a virgin. I never had a boyfriend or been in a situation were I was close to losing my virginity, so it’s been easy pretty easy to stay a virgin.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">How have your dates/partners reacted?</span><br />I've only been to a couple of dates so I never had to confess I was a virgin. I have only confessed that I’m a virgin to a limited number of people at my uni and they all acted pretty surprised. I had been told that I simply don’t look like a virgin because I am "attractive" and quite flamboyant. I don’t know whether to feel flattered or not about this.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Anything else you want to say about virginity or our cultural attitudes towards it?</span><br />I wish that I could honestly say that I embrace and love the fact I am a virgin, but to be honest I don’t. I feel ashamed that I am a virgin who has never even been in a relationship. I remember sitting in art class one day and the issue of sexuality arising. A guy said that he was not going to censor himself because everybody in class had sex, or something along those lines.<br /><br />Although I understand that most college students are not virgins, label me crazy but I felt embarrassed. It is as if once you reach a certain age you are expected to have sex and if you don’t then you are a loser. For now, I plan to solely focus on my studies and hopefully the right guy will show up someday.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Tell us how you define virginity, how you lost/kept it, and anything else about the v-word.

She talks to us about her Indian upbringing, the appeal of the single life and being "intellectually whore-<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">ish</span>."</span></span><span><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">  Please send us an <a href="mailto:info@trixiefilms.com">email</a> if you'd like to tell your story. </span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tell us about yourself:</span><br />I am a 19-year-old university student. I have never had a serious relationship in my life and I am a virgin.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">How do you define virginity?</span><br />One can technically define virginity as a not having had sexual intercourse, but I don't see either the state of being virginal or non-virginal as having some characteristics intrinsically associated with it.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why have you decided to stay a virgin?</span><br />I could ponder over many of the psychosocial reasons for this state, but at the end of the day, it doesn't really differentiate me from the biggest sluts or studs as a person. I don't really think much about my virginity to be honest, because I don't think having sex will change me as a person. I think we are past the day and age when losing one's virginity was a rite of passage. With the information age, and the increasingly greater emphasis on the individual, I feel like virginity or the loss of it is an invalid concern to understand a person.<br /><br />I guess I should provide some context as to how I was raised to think about virginity. My parents, being moderately liberal Indians, weren't big on arranged marriages or religion, however, they told me to be consistently "careful" with matters of the heart or the body. I don't know what they meant by it, but they insisted that I didn't do things that would make me "sick". This made me a big prude for a few of my teenage years. Later, I cast off that prudishness, and became way more open-minded and accepting of my own sexuality. That helped me become a more easy-going person.<br /><br />In my social circle, I'm quite open about my sexual thoughts and desires, as are most of the virgins who I hang out with. A lot of us have been career-minded freaks with no patience for womanly ways or charms, we have turned into this group of overgrown tomboys who are sometimes really horny. We talk about it. We talk about our masturbation habits. We seldom feel like we are missing out on much because we aren't getting laid. Mind you, we are probably an unfortunate bunch of outliers. I guess intimate romantic relationships haven't been near the top on our list of priorities.<br /><br />I have a lot of male friends who I am equally open with. Many will say that I don't really feel romantic feelings so much, because I have never been treated like a woman by a man. I don't expect to, or want to be treated according to my gender. The few serious romantic feelings I have had in my life towards men are rooted in an intellectual attraction. I've been intellectually whore-<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">ish</span> as long as I can remember, and it seems it's probably gonna be the only way I would ideally like to get physically laid in.<br /><br />Since I was a child, as I have written in my blog recently, I romanticized the idea of a single life with other single people. While I no longer fantasize about living in a convent, I admire the bachelor lifestyle that a lot of college students live. It will get old one day, for sure, but I enjoy how it helps me grow as a person. I feel a bond with every person I have shared living space with, gotten drunk with or had an intellectual debate with. Being with someone will probably take away how much I cherish each and every individual so much, and I am sort of afraid for that.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Any special plans or ideas for losing it?</span><br />I do yearn to be in a relationship. Sex can come in the context of it. I am not the one for random one night stands, unless it involves massive instant attraction of intellect and some sort of pseudo-spiritual connection. I am still unsure. I don't have many regrets about what I have been through so far. Despite having no luck whatsoever in love, I feel confident and positive about myself. I don't hold back and I am usually easy to get along with. For now, that is enough for me.]]></content:encoded>

(Hey, it's 41–soon to be 42–years worth of "baggage.")<br /><br />The Cliff Notes version: I'm Asian, so as a kid growing up in "White" America of the late 60s, early 70s, I was pretty much ostracized. (Vietnam, Remember that little "police action?")<br /><br />By the time I reached "dating" age (high school and college), I pretty much held to the notion that "education" in preparation for a GREAT career was EVERYTHING--and the ONLY THING that "mattered." In high school, I went to specialized, "magnet" school where most of the study body commuted, via NYC subways, every day.<br /><br />And college was pretty much the same... I, along with all the "friends" I "hung out with" were all about studying and getting "the golden ticket" to a great career. So, by the time I was in "my prime" (the mid- to late-20s) it was all about the career. "Let me make my first million (dollars) and I'll have time."<br /><br />Add to all this that I'm a devout born-again Christian and really do hold to a personal belief that sex is something special to be shared ONLY with someone who is truly a "soul mate"... And, well... let's just say that at this point in my life, I still haven't found that "special someone" yet. Corny? Maybe.<br /><br />But I look around at my "peers" in my age bracket who, by now, have gone through one or two or more marriages and well... Just what exactly did I "miss"? During the wild 80s and 90s, there was too much emphasis with sex (Get it as soon as and as often as you can and damn the consequences!) and not so much on the "relationship" side of things.<br /><br />Which leads me to wonder... Why is it that a majority of the focus is on old male virgins? Where are all the older female virgins?  What is up with that?<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Tell us how you define virginity, how you lost/kept it, and anything else about the v-word.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I wonder why more people don&#39;t pick up on the fact that Christians worship a 2,000 year old male virgin named Jesus. Normally Jesus&#39; virginity would make him a very low-ranking beta male and an object of derision (refer to Roissy in DC&#39;s blog for his ongoing discussion about alpha males, beta males and sex). So I can see why some people want to resolve the cognitive dissonance by postulating that Jesus did in fact have a wife (Mary Magdalene) during his earthly existence, thereby raising his status in the male dominance hierarchy. (I&#39;ve read that Mormons teach that Jesus had several earthly wives, which would raise his status even higher in a religion that has a history of polygyny.)]]></wp:comment_content>

She talks to us about the importance of respect, her concerns about <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">STDs</span> and why she thinks her wedding night will be so sweet.  Please send us an <a href="mailto:info@trixiefilms.com">email</a> if you'd like to tell your story. </span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tell us about yourself:</span><br />I'm a 19 years old Chinese girl, Yarn. I know most of the people about my age had lost their virginity. Yet it doesn't influence me to follow the trend. Somehow, I stand strong for my own viewpoint and hold my virginity until the day I get married with the love one.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is your definition of virginity?</span><br />Virginity is the first time. When a person said he/she lost his/her virginity, it means that the person lost his/her first time by having sexual intercourse with another person. In other words, a virgin is a person who does not have any sexual experience with another person.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why have you decided to stay a virgin?</span><br />Virginity is very important for Chinese, especially female. If a person married with person who is not virgin, it will drop their family reputation. I'm still a virgin. Why I choose to be virgin? Virginity is just like balloon, one poke and it's gone. Why I don't keep it for my beloved one? It is so precious. Giving it to a stranger or just friend, what if you pregnant? Condom? Condom only 99%, you still have a chance to get pregnant. If get pregnant, my dreams will gone. And who is going to be responsible for the baby? What about STD (Sexually Transmitted Diseases)? These<br />diseases usually transmit via free sex. If after marriage, it means you will go for a body check-up before marriage. It is safer. But what if premarital sex? You do not ask the person: "Hey, if you want to have sex with me, go for check up first and bring the report to me." Do you say that?? Stay virgin is actually a way to protect myself and my future partner.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">How have your dates/partners reacted?</span><br />Hey, if you love me, you have to respect me. If you already manage to stay with me forever, why can't you wait until the day we married? Love doesn't have to show through sex.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Any special plans or ideas for losing it?</span><br />My first marriage night. It's gonna be so memorable and sweet. Because I lost it for a person who loves me and will take care of me. Romantic. We waited so long just for that day to come. Get married, first sex to each other and have our own family.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Anything else you want to say about virginity?</span><br />Sex couldn't last forever, when you get older, you can't afford for that. But true love will make life better. I believe life without sex could be happy and enjoy too. I had attend a workshop about<br />virginity. The only way to protect yourself, not getting pregnant or STD,  is only abstinence. It works for 100% safety. Sometimes, virginity is a good instrument to test who really cares and loves you. Let's say, one guy come to you and say he loves you, you are the only one for him, could you have sex with him. Well, if you say no, I want to save my virginity until I married and he just hates you for that, he is not sincere to you. Oppositely, he accepts and is willing to wait until the big day. Congratulations, he is a person you can have as a life partner. Remember that, when a guy says "I love you" he might mean "I want have sex wit you." Girls should learn to protect yourself.]]></content:encoded>

She talks to us about recovering from trauma, </span></span><span><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">how she defines virginity, </span></span><span><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);"> and the ways in which sex can bond us to others.  Please send us an <a href="mailto:info@trixiefilms.com">email</a> if you'd like to tell your story. </span></span><br /><br /><b>Tell us about yourself</b><br />I’m a  21 year old average female. I consider myself ‘heteroflexible,’ primarily attracted to males but not opposed to the idea of being with a women. I come from a conservative catholic family and we don’t talk about sex ever. I never even got a ‘use protection’ talk or ‘wait till your married’ talk and to this day wonder if my parents ever suspect I’ve had sex. Away from my family I’m much more liberal and open minded about sex and even recently started a blog about various things including sex.<br /><br /><b>What is your definition of virginity?</b><br />Since I have many GLBTQ friends I know the ‘penis in a vagina’ definition is not a good one for everyone, however if I had to define it in concrete terms for me and other heteronormal couples I would say sex is either vaginal or anal penetration with the penis. Using tampons and sex toys doesn't count, and I don't think anal sex is a loop hole. I gave oral sex before having sex and still considered myself a virgin at that point, although I know for many people that’s a gray area.<br /><br /><b>Why did you decide to stay a virgin?</b><br />I never decided to stay a virgin till married, however I also always knew it was something I wanted to be special, and I didn’t want to lose it during a one night stand but at least to someone I was in a safe long term and loving relationship with eve if they weren't 'The One'. I was frustrated because for quite awhile I felt like a very sexual person and was ready to sex, but wasn’t able to maintain a serious relationship long enough to be comfortable with them. Some of the guys I dated left after finding out my number was 0 and realizing I wouldn’t get ready to have sex for awhile. But I wasn’t ready to have casual sex like many of my friends.<br /><br /><b>When did you lose your virginity?</b><br />It’s hard to explain but I think of 3 different times when I think of losing my virginity. My first sexual experience was sadly date rape from a slightly older ‘mentor’ student during my freshman year of college. While at his house he drugged me, then took me back to my room, and had sex with me. I only remember unpleasant flashes of it but I know he penetrated me, thus according to my own definition taking my virginity. However, I never consented and after recovering from the incident I found I continued to identify as a virgin, partly because I didn’t even feel attached to my body at the time. However, I still struggled with the idea that he may have taken my ‘technical’ virginity.<br /><br />Later I began dating someone and eventually felt ready to have consensual sex and truly lose my virginity to him both physically and spiritually. However he had some health problems and we were never able to consecrate the act fully due to problems on his part which prevented any penetration, yet I had be willing and we had tried several times so I felt that I had ‘given’ some part of myself to him, perhaps my ‘spiritual’ virginity.<br /><br />Eventually when dating someone else it finally happened, we had actual penetrative sex that I agreed to. The first time was a little awkward and mechanical and just sex, but later it became making love. I told him the previous stories, and for the most part I believe we both consider him my first, just with a tiny asterisk next to it (in conversation I find myself saying, "John Smith with my first... sort of"). Generally I think of this is the ‘true’ time I lost my virginity.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Anything else you want to say about virginity?</span><br />In the end I think it’s everyone’s right to define sex and virginity as they want. I also have no problem with people who want (safe) casual sex. I just know for me sex is special and tied to emotions very strongly, a not just something physical my body is doing. Each time I ‘lost it’ I went through some difficult emotionally changes, partly because a word I had define a part of myself as my entire life was now gone. At times I wish my first time was all magical, in a field of flowers and ending in 5 multiple orgasms like I was lead to believe, but I don’t regret it. It was what it was, I can’t change it, and it has lead me to where I am now, having sex with some I love, and it truly has deepened and enhanced our bond in unimaginable ways.]]></content:encoded>

He talks to us about what women really want,</span><span><span style="font-style: italic; color: #660000;"> virginity testing in the police force, and why newspaper reporting and a love life don't always mix. If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong>. We'd love to run it in this blog!
</span></span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tell us about yourself:</span>
I am a 28-year-old, heterosexual male – born and bred in the American Midwest but moved to Southeast Asia to cling to the dream of working in newspapers. On top of being a virgin, I've never been kissed and haven't managed so much as one date in the past 10 years.

Mind you, that's not a plea for help or an attempt to foist blame for my situation on others (like those truly frightening <a href="http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2009/08/05/true-forced-loneliness">YouTube videos</a> Dan Savage linked to recently). My foibles are my own and of my own doing. I knew back in high school that being a reporter at a daily newspaper would entail long, strange hours and likely preclude any chance at a social life, and yet years down the road, here I am, still in the game.

Why? Because this is what stirs my passions. Staring at a blank page every day with the chance to create, inform and entertain is still irresistible. My profession may not last forever – heck, it might not make it to the end of the month at this rate – but as long as I have this, I'm OK with being alone. When it's gone? Well....

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How do you define virginity?</span>
Every person, it seems, has their own line of demarcation. In my mind, you relinquish your V-Card upon consensual vaginal or anal penetration (if, however, it is taken against your wishes, a mulligan is more than justified).

Oral sex isn't quite as cut and dried. It is a form of sex, but I can understand how one might still consider themselves a virgin despite having engaged in oral. As long as it's done in moderation (37? In a row?), I see no problem with that.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why have you decided to stay a virgin?</span>
It wasn't so much a decision as it was just how things played out. I voluntarily gave up my nights and weekends when I got into the business, and having mostly worked on smaller staffs, pulling six-day and/or 50- to 60-hour work weeks is not uncommon. When you work while everyone else plays, it's hard to be social.

Lately, I've been wondering if I'm not social because I work so much, or is it I work so much because I'm not social? I've never been good with small talk (I much prefer to listen and then ask questions – shocking for someone in my line of work), and things like flirting and body language are utterly lost on me. At least when I'm interviewing someone, I have a clear, defined goal of getting the other person to open up and express more than just the usual yes/no/basic facts responses. As long as I have that goal in mind, I can do what I need to do without coming across as a complete nebbish.

Once I lose that, though, and I'm on my own in a social situation, things – as Lewis Black would say – take a turn. A reporter who manages to survive and thrive despite a complete lack of social acumen ... I'm not sure whether that's hilarious or sad.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Any special plans or ideas for losing it?</span>
Not really. I used to tell myself that waiting for marriage would be my way of retaining my honor and showing my prospective bride that I thought so highly of her that I was willing to wait however long it might take to find her.

That, perhaps not surprisingly, turns out to be bunk. Most women – or at least the intelligent, strong, capable ones to whom I am attracted – don't want a white knight riding to their rescue on a shimmering steed. They want a similarly intelligent, fully formed man who is confident and comfortable in his own skin. Being a "Nice Guy" just means they don't run screaming at your presence, and keeping yourself "pure" in anticipation of the already over-hyped Wedding Night doesn't mean jack – especially if you don't have anything interesting to talk about in the awkward silence that will inevitably follow.

**Ahem** Sorry, got a little rant-y there. Where was I? Ah, yes – not really. If it happens, odds are you won't hear me complaining. If not, I'll know why. I'll just keep stumbling along while my peers all stay conversant in the Things You Should Know About Dating By Now (TM).

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How have your dates/partners reacted?</span>
You can count the number of people I've told about my virginity on one hand. Reactions have varied from mild surprise ("I didn't know people still did that.") to dismissiveness ("Then you got no chance with me, buster.") to the old stand-by ("I just assumed you were gay.").

My family does not fit into that one hand, incidentally. My two younger siblings and I never had any of The Talks (drugs, sex, etc.) – when asked, our parents' response was always, "You're smart. You'll figure it out." I don't feel compelled to share this with them, and none of my friends are close enough to where I'd feel comfortable sharing such information ... perhaps that's why this all flows forth so easily on the Interwebs.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Anything else you want to say about virginity?</span>
Moving to Indonesia gave me a whole new perspective on virginity and women's issues as a whole. One of the first stories I read when I arrived was about how women were now allowed to serve as police officers ... provided they kept up with their cooking, sewing and beauty classes and passed their monthly virginity checks (!). The only thing that stunned me more than that revelation was how everyone around me just took it as a matter of course. I thought of myself as open-minded and sympathetic to the cause of women before, but seeing the way women and girls here are subjugated now makes me viscerally angry.

As for virginity: This may sound odd, coming as it does at the end of all this yodeling, but it's really not that big of a deal -- or at least it shouldn't be. Whether or not your genitalia have carnal knowledge of another set of genitalia has next to no bearing on your status as a person. The sooner people wrap their heads around that, the sooner we can move on to something important – like the lack of communication and emotional intimacy that persists despite people having more ways to speak to each other than ever before.

I've gone 28 years without sex, and I imagine I can wait a while longer. What I don't want to miss, though, is that emotional intimacy, that feeling of being able to implicitly love and trust someone else and have them feel likewise toward you. That's probably a trickier and more time-consuming pursuit, but it's also more rewarding than worrying about who's stuck what in whom and how often.]]></content:encoded>

We get a lot of stories through our comments and occasionally we share them here.

</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I'm 21 and still a virgin.</span> I was brutally sexually assaulted as a toddler and there are still physical scars from the assault, besides all of the mental ones. I don't feel that me remaining a virgin this long is something I would've chosen if not for the assault. I have a natural respect for sex itself and I'm quite open in talking about it and exploring it (with myself) but a whole bunch of neuroses I'm usually not aware I have come into play when the chance to explore it with someone else pops up. I have no problems being friends with guys (especially because of how hard I am to offend) but it becomes a different thing all together when the issue of sex comes up.

I think there's so much media focus on sex that it seems impossible to live without it, but I view it as a bit of a hype phenomenon. Sort of how seeing so many reaction videos to [notorious porn film] <span style="font-style: italic;">2 Girls, 1 Cup</span> makes you wonder what all of the fuss is about. Sex has lost its place as a natural part of living, and I think that contributes to all of the pressure to have a sex life and start early. It's been turned into a commodity to own.

I don't personally wish to go my whole life celibate, particularly because I seem to be a naturally sexual person and it seems that exploring my sex life will be the best way for me to heal from my trauma. I think that it's possible to live without sex, that people exist who are truly asexual and don't see the need for it or who have good reasoning for avoiding it.

So, we invited her to do a First Person for us about it. </span></span><span><span style="font-style: italic; color: #660000;">If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong>. We'd love to run it in this blog! </span></span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tell us about yourself:</span>
I'm a 26-year-old straight female. I grew up in a liberal household, with an ex-hippie, onetime sex educator, feminist mom. No religious or social taboos about sex to be found. The general attitude about sex was just: be safe and do it with someone you care about.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">What is your definition of virginity?</span>
This is a complicated question, because for people of different orientations, with different options for sex, it means different things. For me, as a heterosexual female, it's penetration. I think that oral sex is still "sex," but especially as a woman with the potential first-time pain that comes along with vaginal intercourse, the sort of trust that requires, virginity is for me about intercourse.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Why did you decide to stay a virgin?</span>
It's funny - my first response is "Oh, no, it was not my choice!" I never wanted to be a virgin through my mid-twenties. I did have chances to have sex in college and after that I didn't go for because I wasn't ready, either for sex in general or sex with that person. For a long while I wanted to lose my virginity in the context of a serious, committed relationship and I have dated people, but nothing serious or long-term. At some point I decided I didn't need a boyfriend to lose my virginity, but it still took a while to find the right person and situation. (I think actually finding the right person outside of that framework - as in, not my boyfriend - may have been what changed my mind about that.)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">When did you lose your virginity?
</span>A few months ago, at the ripe old age of 26 I spent a night with a guy I'd <span style="font-style: italic;">briefly</span> dated a couple of years ago. Just after we'd gone out on a couple of dates, he'd moved to another town, but now almost two years later, he was here for a weekend for work. I still felt very comfortable with him, loved spending time with him, and trusted him. We didn't have intercourse, but we went farther than I'd gone sexually before. He said something about "You should come visit me in my town," and sure enough, my job took me there for a weekend a few months later. We agreed I'd stay at his place. I was nervous and also somewhat on a mission.

I got a lot of good, thoughtful advice from <a href="http://www.scarleteen.com/">Scarleteen.</a> Although I'm about ten years out of their target demographic, it was really helpful to read other people's experiences of losing their virginity. I don't talk about sex much with my friends, and definitely not about my insecurities about being a virgin in my mid-twenties. Hearing from women who ended up waiting and were totally fine–socially-adjusted, sexy, smart–was great. One thing I read was that you should tell your partner that you're a virgin in the interest of openness. If it's your first time, you want the guy to be a little more... gentle than he might otherwise be. So I decided he needed to know.

On my second night with this guy, in the middle of fooling around, I told him. Or rather, I stopped what we were doing, and sat there for about five minutes trying to get the words out of my mouth. I really hate the the phrase "I'm a virgin"–it makes it seem like virginity is your defining characteristic. I'm a person who happens to not have had sex. I finally got the words out (I think it was "I haven't had sex before") and we talked a lot about it. He was a remarkably sweet, open, communicative person–my instinct that I could trust him was right. And then, well, you get the idea.

He was concerned that it wouldn't be good for me to lose my virginity to someone I wouldn't get to see or date, that it would set me up to be hurt. But the fact is, and I told him this, a boyfriend who lives in your town can hurt you, too, and this way I knew what to expect - that I would get on that plane at the end of the weekend and go. It didn't have to be a bigger deal than that. Do I sometimes now feel really, really sad that we don't live in the same town? Yes. Would I miss him less if we hadn't had intercourse? No. The intimacy was already there. This was just another aspect of it.

I wondered if I'd feel different afterwards, like something major about me had changed, and for the most part I don't. Having sex was just another step along the gradual slope of sexual experience. This was just the one where you really ought to tell someone that what you're doing is new. I do feel freer now to pursue sex–now that there's no big-deal disclosure necessary beforehand–so I want to go out there, find people I like, and have sex with them and enjoy myself. That's my mission now.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This is just such a cool story. I approached losing my virginity in a similarly &quot;rational&quot; matter (if anything about sex is rational!). I was a few years younger, but I felt the same sense of liberation afterward. The sex was meh, but I felt as though I&#39;d been set loose upon the world.<br /><br />I love these stories, Trixie - and I think lots of people benefit from reading them. We all think of ourselves as not fitting the mold - whatever the mold may be! - and the sheer variety of experience is incredibly reassuring.]]></wp:comment_content>

We get a lot of stories through our comments and occasionally we share them here. </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong>. We'd love to run it in this blog!
</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I'm under 30, but I think that it is kind of a weird thing</span> to still be a virgin when you're in your mid 20s. I know women who have and are still virgins, but they have those strong religious ties. I don't really have those reasons anymore (I did when I was teen, and I signed this stupid card that said I would only kiss boys "lightly" whatever that means. Oh, and sex was out of the question).

Since I've figured out that I'm bi. I would love to have sex with someone I actually like, no matter the gender.

But I'm still a virgin because I'm really shy, really scared, and I have a hard time getting close to people physically, not even on a sexual level. Also, I've always been focused on what I've been doing right now, not on relationships. (True story: Broke up with my first boyfriend because he'd rather snuggle than let me do homework.)

It's weird, but you get to the point to where you lie about sex for your friends or smile and nod at their stories, like you know where their coming from (no pun intended) when you have no idea what's its like. It's expected that you've had sex, and if you haven't, you must be really religious...or have vagina dentata.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);" class="MsoNormal"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_GrDUC546uig/SZ8Zbfx4aVI/AAAAAAAAAUI/zbhTKbRTZLU/s1600-h/Picture+1.png"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 126px; height: 153px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_GrDUC546uig/SZ8Zbfx4aVI/AAAAAAAAAUI/zbhTKbRTZLU/s200/Picture+1.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5304986846243613010" border="0" /></a>Inspired by our new muse, Kate Monro and the <a href="http://theamericanvirgin.blogspot.com/2009/01/kate-monro-wants-to-know-how-you-lost.html">The Virginity Project</a>, we're launching a new feature called <span style="font-weight: bold;">First Person</span>. </p><p style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);" class="MsoNormal">We've heard stories from a lot of you privately, so thanks to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Loretta</span> for bustin' out and being the first to share with all! The American Virgin interviewed her about the v-word:<br /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b style="">TAV: What is your definition of virginity?</b><br /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Loretta: My definition of virginity is someone who hasn’t had intercourse including anal. This also includes not using a dildo if you are a lesbian. This does not include oral sex.<b style=""><br /></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b style="">When did you lose your virginity, or why have you decided to stay a virgin?</b><br /></p><p class="MsoNormal">It was never really my intention to stay a virgin. I think one of my problems is that I have too many friends and acquaintances. I found other ways to entertain myself and having sex just never was on the top of my list of things to do. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal">I have actually tried several times to lose my virginity to no avail. I know!</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">The problem is, for me to have sex, it needs to be with someone I trust, someone I am comfortable with. Unfortunately for me, all my guy friends whom I have begged and still beg today refuse to take my virginity. They keep telling me they can’t. They want me to lose it to a stranger and then they can have sex with me. How ironic, right? Because I want to have sex with someone I am comfortable with – a friend.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style=""><o:p> </o:p></b></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="">How have your dates/partners reacted?</b><br /></p><p class="MsoNormal">Most of the guys I’ve dated first start off saying how much they respect me for being a virgin . However, I know in the back of their minds, they think this is a game. They feel like they will be the ones to dis-virgin me. A couple of months into the relationship with no sex, and things begin to change.<br /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Some of them cheated on me saying that they needed sex and I wasn’t giving, others at least had the decency to end the relationship so they could pursue someone who was sexually active. I broke up with some because I could see their pain…lol…so I let them go. Right now I’m talking to a guy who I think is also a virgin. My first time, so this should be interesting.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Any special plans or ideas for losing it?<o:p></o:p></b></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Ha! My plans are very simple, if I can find someone <a href="http://theamericanvirgin.blogspot.com/search/label/Virginity%20Auctions">willing to offer me a lot of money</a>, just to have sex with me because I am a virgin, I will not think twice about it! If I knew how to contact the Bunny Ranch and set this up, I would have done it a long time ago. So if any body knows anyone who can help me out with this please contact me.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""> </span><span style=""> </span>Before anyone judges that, at least am getting something out of it versus the millions of young women who got nothing but pregnancy or a broken heart after loosing theirs. I can’t count the number of times I’ve heard a woman say how much she regretted loosing her virginity. You know why? Because they got nothing out of it. At least nothing good.<b style=""><br /></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Anything else you want to say about virginity?</b> </p>  <p class="MsoNormal">I’m a virgin. Big deal. Sex is sex. I don’t understand why people have placed it on such a high pedestal. I believe that one can still enjoy a fruitful happy life without sex. I’m a witness to that. Being a virgin has not stopped me from having a very active social life. It does not define me. It is just one of the many qualities that make me the person I am today. I have had 3 marriage proposals and turned them all down because I am not ready to settle down.<br /></p><p style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;" class="MsoNormal">Tell us how you define virginity, how you lost/kept it, and anything else about the v-word. Email your answers to  info*at*trixiefilms.com.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Today <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rosie</span> tells us about her first time and her thoughts about the V-word itself.</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><br />How do I define virginity?</span><br />I'll stick with the tradition view: the penis penetrating the vagina. I do believe oral/anal are a form of sex, i.e. one couldn't claim to be abstinent if they partook in any of these acts.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">How I lost mine:</span><br />I always thought that was a strange way of phrasing the question... as if virginity was something that I posses and that somebody will eventually take away from me...<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Anyway, my story:</span><br />Just after I turned 16 I had met a man... an older man, he was 34 to be exact. Growing up, I had a bad relationship with my father, so when an older man was willing to give me some attention and make me feel special, it was hard to resist even though I knew the situation was really wrong. I knew I was being taken advantage of, but it was nice to feel wanted.<br /><br />The first time we had sex was a very strange experience. Most of it was the feeling of just wanting to get it over with, both in the psychological and physical sense. I just remember it being horrendously painful to the point where I was nearly crying and wanting it to be over. <span>However, once I crossed that line I couldn't help but feel used, as if I was now officially "damaged goods".</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why we need to talk about virginity:</span><br />I think this project of yours takes a very interesting look at how our society views virginity. <span>It seems to be something that is revered yet not something you want to brag about.</span> I know my friends hate telling guys that they are virgins because most guys either don't want to be the one to "take it" or they are way too aroused by the idea of it.<br /><br />Additionally, I wanted to share my story since most often <span>between t.v., movies, and magazines, losing your virginity is this romanticized event, yet I'm sure most women have stories that range from lack luster to disturbing.</span> Personally, I feel like I can't tell my story to people because they'll look at me differently or think ill of me for losing mine how I did.<br /><br />I'm 21 now, and I still feel conflicted with how I lost mine... a part of me is really glad it's over, another part wants to forget the whole thing, and another really wishes it could have been a more pleasant experience.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Tell us how you define virginity, how you lost/kept it, and anything else about the v-word.

He lost his erection because he was so nervous and at some time it seemed impossible to me that his penis could ever fit 'down there',because it was hurting so much. I remember thinking it was just so unfair to women that it can hurt. I only loved the experience because it was with the man I loved so dearly, but objectively, it wasn't that great an experience. The second time was way better! And although we're not together any more, I wouldn't want it to have been with no one else!]]></wp:comment_content>

By the way, the title and artwork of the original post is "Peg." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegging_%28sexual_practice%29">You learn something new every day...</a> Here's Kate's intro:<br /><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;"></span><blockquote style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;">It is not just that there are so many different types of virginity to lose – we have seen on this very blog that not everyone is so fixated on the idea of virginity loss being limited to the penetrative experience. People have written about first loves, first climaxes, first all sorts of everything.<br /><br />But no man has ever written about his first experience of anal sex – with a woman.</span>  <span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;">It is only through the total relinquishing of control, from letting go of the idea of being the ‘giver’ and becoming the so called ‘receiver’ that a man can begin to understand the sexual act from a female point of view – quite literally.</span> </blockquote>Here's the start of Brad's story. He's a stay-at-home father of four. It might make you think about the dynamics of hetero sex, control, consent and power in a whole new way.<br /><blockquote style="font-family: trebuchet ms; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">‘I am not exactly sure what qualifies as losing one's virginity. I suppose that it's commonly thought to be when one engages in sexual intercourse. By that definition I lost mine when I was eighteen. But that's not what I am writing about here.<br /><br />I have been married for more than fifteen years and was dating my wife for three years before then.  I took her virginity (if that is the right way to put it) two years before we were married, when we were each in our mid-twenties.  But that's not what I am writing about here either...<br /><br />'...[My wife] first brought up the idea of anal. I was, to put it mildly, petrified.  Visions of ‘being gay’ ran through my head.  She assured me I wasn't but I tried to let the topic die.  She wouldn't.  She brought it up the next morning and eventually we made a date to meet for lunch and then go to a sex-toy store, just to look.'<br /></blockquote>Yeah, it sounds a little like Letters to Penthouse Forum, but trust me, it isn't.

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I am 19-year-old woman from Arizona.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Virginity is being pure in body. However, there are multiple types of virginity that one can have the pleasuring experience of losing.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

A few years back, I gave up on the idea of waiting for marriage. I knew I wanted my first time to be with someone special though, and I was more than willing to wait for him. If you had caught me a few years prior to that change in mind, I would have been terrified at the very thought of anyone else having premarital sex.

I just needed to open up my mind a bit to realize that sex isn't a dirty thing. My best friend helped to enlighten me, as well as made me feel more comfortable with the idea of sex. That was around the time I was in 10th grade. One year after that, my best friend and her boyfriend shed themselves of the title of being a virgin. I was happy for them, as well as how sex positive they are.

Now, I am at University. I am in love with an amazing guy who loves me to bits and pieces. Just writing this all down makes me smile like an idiot. When we met, we were both virgins. Now, after nearly six months of knowing each other, we decided to have sex. It didn't hurt. In fact, I loved it! I feel closer to my boyfriend, and I am looking forward to more and more experiences with him. In the bedroom, as well as in life.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm 63, male, living in the San Francisco Bay Area. I work in the technical support group of a huge computer software company. I've been married twice, divorced since 1992, and have been in relationship with another twice-divorced woman my age since early 2005.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

I really have no clue. I think it's a social construct whose definition varies among people and over time. Personally I stopped feeling like a virgin after the first time I had penis-in-vagina sex. But I wouldn't presume to have an opinion on when a lesbian should no longer identify as virgin.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

I started masturbating at age 12, had my first date at 13, and in spite of lots of making out in high school and my first year and a half of college, didn't have penis-in-vagina intercourse until age 20. My mother's last words to me when I walked out the door to go to college were, "Remember, Dan, gentlemen don't take virgins." That was all either parent ever said to me on the topic of sex.

When The Big Event finally happened, it was a disaster. I had been dating Hellen for months and my mind was overwhelmed with the thought, "She's letting me do it!" I couldn't get an erection to save my soul. After some time passed, I was finally able to complete intercourse. but I was so self-involved the whole time, I wouldn't blame Hellen a bit if she felt completely disconnected from me through the whole experience. Our relationship lasted only another year and a half.

I met another girl early in my senior year with whom I thought I fell in love, and she agreed to marry me. She wanted to be a virgin on her wedding night, and I reluctantly resolved not to pressure her about it. I was woefully inexperienced, and she had no experience at all, so after our first intercourse in our honeymoon hotel, she told me, "If I had know that that's all it was going to be, I wouldn't have waited." From that day forward I never once felt like an adequate lover for her. The marriage barely lasted five years.

Another dear friend from high school kept herself virginal and walked down the aisle with her high school sweetheart as pure as the driven snow, but discovered after the wedding that he was actually gay, a fact that might have come to light if she had been open to a test drive.

These experiences have naturally led me to the conclusion that marrying as a virgin is a bad idea. Your mileage may vary, of course. Mostly, I am deeply saddened by our culture's active hostility toward any semblance of reason and respect for nature when it comes to every single aspect of human sexuality.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a 16-year-old girl from London.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Virginity is the act when you know someone you love will take it and claim it as theirs, and not think of you as another notch on their bedpost. I have felt for a while that sex is too mainstream nowadays, so I'm waiting until I'm in my 20s to lose my virginity. Sex should be about loving someone, so by letting someone take your v-card, you are showing them you love them enough to take your 'flower'. They show their love for you by treating your v-card with respect and not rushing you into sex just for their convenience.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

It just feels right because I'm too immature to know what the hell I'm doing now, and it creeps me out that some guy my age could take it now, and not care how it affects me when it happens.

I love being a virgin! It gives me time to understand how I will plan my life instead of worrying about sex, sex, sex!]]></content:encoded>

We'd love to run it in this blog! </span></span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tell us about yourself:</span>
I'm 17, I live near the capital of Michigan, and I'm a bisexual female. I like any type of art, I spend a lot of time online, I can't wait to go to college, and I'm involved in my Unitarian <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Universalist</span> church's youth group.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">What is your definition of virginity?</span>
I'm not really sure at this point, because I haven't had a reason to think about it. I've never even been kissed or been in a relationship. I imagine that my first sexual experience will be with a woman, so "virginity" could mean a variety of acts. To me, the meaningful part is the intimacy. I'd also consider non-penetrative sex with a man to constitute the end of my virginity... as long as it's good!

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why have you decided to stay a virgin?</span>
The short answer is that hasn't been a decision. Some of the circumstances that led to it were choices–I focus on my schoolwork, <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">et</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">cetera</span>–but I also am not really considered a sexy person by most people in my area and age group. I don't shave my legs because it's a stupid thing to do, and I give myself a haircut with my dad's electric razor, most recently with a 13mm blade. I wear cute dresses because I like them; but someone like me living around here, especially if I hate parties, isn't going to get a lot of people checking her out.

Another thing is that lot of my social activities either revolve around the church or around school. Unitarian Universalism is a religion that encourages a lot of openness about love and sex –I mean a lot; participating in our Our Whole Lives sex ed program was a life-changing experience for me, though I didn't know it at the time–but that doesn't mean that it's the best place to meet someone. I'm worried that I have some kind of undiagnosed social anxiety disorder that has kept me totally without relationship experience, although it's probably not true.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How have your dates/partners reacted?</span>
I don't date. Again, it's not my intention not to date; I don't have the confidence yet to be the pursuer in a relationship, and the only people who've asked me out have been people I couldn't possibly imagine a relationship with, like people who were vastly overestimating the idea that we were even friends.

I realized I was bisexual because I had a crush on a friend I thought was straight, who later came out to me as bisexual. But she moved away, and I couldn't communicate how much I liked her before she left. I think I actually said it once, but she didn't know I meant it. But who cares about her? That was so long ago. I actually just met a cute bi girl who is so, so fun to talk to, but I know that I don't have the self-confidence to ask her out. Since I missed the experimentation phase because the stupid people I share a town with don't hang out with <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">dykey</span>-looking girls, I don't even know how to ask someone out. What do you say? What do you ask to do? I just don't have any ideas.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Any special plans or ideas for losing it?</span>
I want my first time to be with another girl. I just feel like it'll be more intimate. This makes me not a true bisexual, I guess. I mean, I'd consider it with the right guy, but I just imagine it with a girl. And why not? I'm the one who gets to pick!

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Anything else you want to say about virginity?</span>
I know I'm a bit young for it to be unusual that I'm a virgin, but I really wouldn't be surprised, if this blog is still going when I'm 22 or 25, if I'm not still a virgin then. Plus most people at 17 at least have been kissed, made out or whatever. I'm not a prude at all - I don't think! - but my life is complicated. My friends who just seem to <em>know </em>how to express their interest in someone don't know what a great thing they have going for them!]]></content:encoded>

If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong>. We'd love to run it in this blog!
</span></span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tell us about yourself:</span>
My name is Natalie, and I'm a 24-year-old heterosexual female from the USA, and I'm a law student. I consider oral/vaginal/anal sex to all be "sex".

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why did you decide to stay a virgin?</span>
I grew up in a liberal household and my mom is an Ob/<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Gyn</span>, so sexuality was never a taboo subject. I had no desire to remain "pure" and no strong desire to wed, so waiting till marriage wouldn't work. But my mom made me paranoid about STD/Is and I knew I would never be promiscuous. Plus, I am kind of picky in regards to my friends and my lovers so I wanted to have sexual activity within the context of a relationship.

I went on oral contraceptives at 17 in preparation for college and my mother sent me away with a huge supply of condoms/Plan B. Since I don't drink (a huge activity in college) and spent my time hanging out in the theater department, so meeting men I was interested in didn't really happen. I went on a few dates, kissed some guys, made great friends but nobody I wanted to be in a relationship with appeared.

Around my 20<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">th</span> birthday, I began to feel ashamed about my lack of sexual experience. I began to doubt myself, my attractiveness, my <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">desirability,</span> my <span style="font-style: italic;">normalcy.</span> I even started to question if was heterosexual (I definitely was). It seemed the thing that came so easily to everyone else (sex) was so difficult for me. The only individuals I knew who had never engaged in any type of sexual activity beyond kissing at my age were religiously motivated.

I ended up going 3 years without so much as kissing someone and that made me very depressed. There were nights I would cry myself to sleep just because I longed to be touched, to feel that connection to another human being. The worse thing was feeling as if it would <span style="font-style: italic;">never</span> change, and I would <span style="font-style: italic;">never</span> have the experiences I longed for. I no longer felt my lack of sexual experience was a choice – it felt more like a punishment. However, I was determined not to have a roll in the hay with the first guy who looked my way.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How did you lose your virginity?</span>
I had vaginal and oral sex, touched a penis and laid in bed with a naked man for the first time on my 23rd birthday from approximately midnight to 6am! It was the happiest day of my life, and all of the things I thought I would be – scared, nervous, ashamed – I wasn't any of those things. I was just happy.

I had moved back to my home city the year before to go to law school, and 7 months before my birthday I met a guy who lived in my building. I was attracted to him instantly and for the first time I felt as if someone wanted me as much as I wanted them. It was sweet and pleasurable and intimate and completely worth staying up till 6am for! However, we broke up a few months later due to things entirely not related to sex. I don't regret our experience together for one second.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">I never told him I had never had sex because:</span>
1.When my friend R., who believed oral sex wasn't sex, finally decided she wanted to have vaginal intercourse, she was rejected four times. I was afraid the same thing would happen to me: guys would learn I had never had vaginal intercourse and back out during the heat of foreplay. I didn't want to risk that – or risk that he would find it <span style="font-style: italic;"><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">attractive</span></span> that I was "untouched." Both were equally distasteful.

2. I didn't think it was any of his business! My sexual life before him was private, and once we both got tested before we had sex, I had no desire to learn about his previous sexual experiences. Having penetrated myself with sex toys for the last few years I knew there was no need to worry about pain or discomfort.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">My thoughts on virginity</span>:
The emotional baggage that went along with feeling unwanted and undesirable and "different/defective" was much more damaging than the physical act of never having had sex. If I want t0 have an orgasm I can through masturbation. While the physical gratification can't be overlooked, how I feel mentally about my sexuality is much more important than what body part has touched another body part. I am happy that my first time was everything I wanted it to be. Maybe because I spent years and years waiting for it, the universe threw me a bone!

I'm not going to be less picky about who I choose to be with just because I am no longer a virgin. I believe our culture places too much emphasis on the first time one has sex (especially for women) as if the first time is the <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> time that is special, the <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> time one should consider if sex is the right choice for you. If everyone was as particular about the 50<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">th</span> they had sex as they were about the first, I think many of the negative consequences of sex (emotional and physical) would be minimized.]]></content:encoded>

Over the years, I’<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">ve</span> had a lot of interesting conversations about my reasons for staying sexless. While I’m not surprised when people disagree with or even insult my choices, there’s one response that’s surprised me: wistfulness.</span></span>

A woman will realize I’m still a virgin and the next thing I know, she’s congratulating me and musing about her own love life, especially its disappointments. The bad sex. The frequent bad sex. The great sex with men who <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">didn</span>’t stick around. And those are just the stories they’<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">ve</span> shared with me. When I hear things like that, it lessens my sense of "loss" about spending a decade without sex (I’m 31).

We tend to think of abstention as missing out, but in reality, what my chastity has denied me is not 10 years of fabulous sex, but an even deeper pain on each occasion when some guy I liked or dated walked away from me. As Alain <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">de</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">Botton</span> said in his novel The Romantic Movement, "A more melancholy way of looking at the history of sexual technique was to read it as a history of disappointment."

No matter how good or bad sex with each man in my past could have been, whatever might have been would not have lasted. Thanks to the clarity of history, I now know that each time I met someone and thought we had great potential, my imagination far surpassed the reality. Even if I had had sex with those men, I still would not have married them — and that for me is the real goal.

I don’t want a boyfriend who, as a pithy coffee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">barista</span> here in San Francisco once put it, would discard me like a shoe or car when he tires of me. I want someone with whom I can build a life. And if it takes only one person to make that happen, why should I need lots of lovers in the meantime?

<span style="font-style: italic;">Experience!</span> You might be shouting. <span style="font-style: italic;">Practice! Finding out if you are compatible in bed, for God’s sake!</span>

But the thing is, all this talk of compatibility translates to, Does he do what I like? Does he meet MY needs? And however common a mindset that might be, it’s fundamentally selfish. This sounds innocent and harmless when we’re talking about our own behavior, but it <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-error">doesn</span>’t take long to realize that we don’t wish others behaved more selfishly toward us. Sex, of course, is difficult. In fact, I suspect it might be one of the hardest human exchanges in which to try to putting another’s needs before your own. I doubt it can be done without extensive practice at unselfishness and denying self-centered impulses in other, easier settings. But since that’s a challenge I face every day when I board a crowded train or use the communal kitchen at the office, I can actually work on becoming the sort of person who’ll be a good lover without getting anywhere near a bed. And by the same measure, I can tell a lot about how selfish or self-giving someone is without ever spending the night with him.

At this point, some have objected that denying a boyfriend sex could in fact be selfish. But with said hypothetical boyfriend, it’s unlikely we would have yet reached the point of pooling all our resources, forging legal ties and so on. That means, there’d be parts of our lives where we’d still be holding onto things, refusing to share or to trust. Holding nothing and sharing everything in a physical sense, then, would mean taking greater risks with my body than I was willing to do with my finances or my future. And that’s not being unselfish, it’s being unwise and unhealthy.

This, in the end, is why I’<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-error">ve</span> become the most grateful for my chastity, freakish or not. It might sometimes earn scorn, derision and rejection, but it’s taught me the importance of being whole as a woman. I’d far rather have that than a fragmented pleasure.<span style="font-style: italic; color: #660000;">

If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong>. We'd love to run it in this blog!
</span></span>

<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tell us about yourself:</span>
I’m 49 years old, white, male, atheist. I grew up in a state on the periphery of the American South. I own way too many books. I work in the hospitality industry in a Southwestern state. I live with a cat named after a pagan Greek female mathematician who was murdered by Christians, though I can’t tell if she’s my cat or if I’m her human.</span>

I’m also well known in a couple of fringe tech subcultures called cryonics and <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">transhumanism</span>, but not for anything notable I’<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">ve</span> accomplished; just for hanging around for a number of years, expressing partly-baked opinions online and coming up with a neologism on one occasion which has apparently "gone viral," as they say.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">What's your definition of virginity?</span>
In my case, I consider myself a virgin because I’<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">ve</span> never ejaculated inside a woman’s vagina, either with or without a condom. That <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">doesn</span>’t mean I haven’t had other kinds of physical contact with women, however. (More on that below.)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why have you decided to remain a virgin?</span>
I haven’t "decided" anything of the sort. One, virginity is the default state, just like not having ever gone skydiving is the default state. Okay, that’s not the best analogy; but you <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">wouldn</span>’t find it odd to meet a man my age who had never jumped out of a plane wearing a parachute. You need the opportunity first, before you can exert yourself to lose both your sexual virginity and your skydiving virginity. That is hard to do if you don’t have either a cooperative woman or the plane and a parachute available.

Two, women serve as the gatekeepers. They have to consent to sexual contact. My sexual desires don’t give me a right or an entitlement to the use of any woman’s body, especially in such an intimate and emotionally complicated way. In other words, women have decided for me that I remain a virgin.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How have your partners reacted?</span>
I’<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">ve</span> had a few dates in my life which <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">didn</span>’t lead to anything. I suppose I’<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-error">ve</span> had only one attempt at a "partner," whom I met in 1994 (when I was 34) through the tech subcultures I mentioned above. She advertised for men interested in cryonics and possibly marriage in a real paper
newsletter that was still published and delivered by mail back then. I contacted her because she seemed a better candidate than any woman I had ever heard of as a plausible girlfriend, and during our long-distance courtship I mentioned my virginity, which intrigued her, I suppose. She agreed to fly out to visit me for sexual relations, which <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-error">didn</span>’t go well at all because I <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-error">couldn</span>’t get an erection to save my life despite our best efforts. I <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10" class="blsp-spelling-error">didn</span>’t, and don’t, have anything medically wrong with me in that area; it’s just that I lacked the conditioned responses to try to start an adult sex life without practice or preparation at age 34.

From hindsight I consider this experience a "freak accident," because if I had met this woman in more socially common way, she probably <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-error">wouldn</span>’t have sexually offered herself to me. A few years later I visited a psychotherapist and told him about my virginity and my sexual dysfunction with this woman. He tried to sell me on a course of treatment with a surrogate and I declined, not only for financial reasons and the distance I’d have to travel; but also because I find the thought of having a strange woman touch me, even in a "professional" capacity, distasteful.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Any general thoughts on virginity?</span>
I conjecture that boys growing up into men have a developmental window from their mid teens through their early 20’s to have their first sexual experiences. If they miss that window, they might have problems trying to initiate their adult sex lives later on.

For example, the sex therapist I mentioned above told me that a lot of his clients are ultra-orthodox Jewish men who don’t start having sex until they get married well into their 20’s, and then discover that their penises don’t want to cooperate. I have to wonder if adult male virgins in other abstinence-obsessed cultures like radical Islam or fundamentalist Christianity also encounter similar problems if they have to wait too long before they gain their community’s approved access to sex in marriage. <span style="font-style: italic; color: #660000;">

If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong>. We'd love to run it in this blog!
</span></span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tell us a little about yourself</span>
I'm 23 and I live in a liberal oasis in a conservative area, an international college community in the middle of the deep south. I classify myself as a pansexual, but I am very rarely attracted to anyone. So far it's been three males, two females, and one androgynous beauty at the local bookstore. I have no idea whether s/he was male or female, and really didn't care.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How do you define virginity?</span>
I don't know that I'd classify oral sex as sex, but it's a question I wrestle with, especially when it comes to lesbian sex. I think the definition of virginity is going to depend on the virgin (or non-virgin) you ask. The entire concept of virginity, particularly the idea that it needs a definite definition in social usage, seems strange to me. We don't have a word for the first time we join a mosh pit or write a novel or eat caviar, unless we actually use "virgin" in some way for it.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why did you decide to stay a virgin/How did you lose virginity?</span>
I stayed a virgin for 22 years because I was never sexually attracted to anyone. I've always been free and easy about sex as far as other people concerned, and I assumed I'd die a contented virgin, possibly in a stereotypical house full of cats. I rarely even masturbated.

When I was 21 I met a guy who changed all that. The interest wasn't just sexual, but that was a big part of it – it was like all those pheromones I'd missed my entire adult life had concentrated down into one individual. I loved him emotionally as well, but I knew it would never be reciprocated (total incompatibility).

I decided I wanted to lose my virginity with him, on the assumption that I might never want to get laid again. I felt so unattractive and insecure about myself that for a year I buckled down and lost 75 pounds. Most people would say I did that for him, but I did it for myself so that I wouldn't spend that time hating myself for how I looked.

I called him up one day and said I might just show up and proposition him one day, and that's what I did. I was nervous, but not during the act – although I was self-conscious enough to keep my shirt on.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How have your partners reacted?</span>
The first guy was extremely nervous, despite having been with other women, even other virgins. I don't think men are used to women treating their virginity cavalierly, and I also think he was aware that I cared vastly more about him than he did about me. <span>I didn't feel like I was "giving him a gift," or whatever BS term gets applied to it. I would have poured the same amount of emotional energy into it whether it was my first time or my fiftieth.</span>

<span>The only other man I've ever been with I was mildly attracted to (being attracted to one person opened the gates a little, I guess). I felt like I'd been cheating on my first, although he was by now hundred of miles away and we hadn't spoken in months. I've dated or flirted with guys since and accidentally led them on, only to shy away before sex was initiated.</span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Any general thoughts on virginity in our society?</span>
I've always found the hymen concept perplexing and I feel alienated from the way virginity is perceived. I hate the idea that virginity something sacred, because the same idea rarely applies to men, and that means they get to collect something rare and lovely that we only have once.]]></content:encoded>

If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong>. We'd love to run it in this blog!</span>

I'm a 33-year-old guy from Oklahoma and I've done some graduate school. In terms of religion, I searched around a lot growing up, and as a child I used to go to church with friends. <span>I had too few social graces in my upbringing, and was grounded much of the time. I struggled my first few years in college trying to learn how the world and people worked. By the time things started crystallizing, I didn't see marriage and myself as a good match. If I was younger, I am curious how much my sex drive would have supplanted that ignorance.

I tend to think of virginity in the Virgin Mary sense. A more technical definition would be mutual masturbation, oral sex, penetration would all disqualify my definition of virginity. I consider virginity a gift given though, so if one is raped they are still a virgin in my book.</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why have you decided to stay a virgin?</span>
A combination of two elements: the freedom of being alone, and my upbringing. For me having sex is only permitted within marriage. So this is more a question of why I have decided to not get married. I'm not sure where to draw the lines between selfishness, not having a lot in common with others, and wanting to give this freedom to God.

I prefer to spend time alone in my own activities than anything that relates to others. Sometimes even to extent of being in conversations and wishing a Cessna or something would crash through the ceiling to make "this" conversation end. I also don't have a lot in common with others beyond the weather, death, and taxes.

The flip side is that in my beliefs and experience, nothing I do in life has any significance unless it fits somehow into the eternal order of things. Being unmarried means I am not distracted by the cares of this world and supporting a family. I can spend this time exploring the world with God. I can ask how the patterns I am interested in are woven together. I then work on art, music, or computer programs that implement such designs.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How have your dates/partners reacted?</span>
I don't date or have partners. I find it hard to know sometimes when it is best to disclose this information.

For example, last week a <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Facebook</span> contact mentioned that she had trouble trusting people and in particular getting close to men. I thought that since she felt comfortable divulging this to me, never having been in a relationship or even kissing would be a strong indicator of a Very Low Probability for attributing such worries to me. It's been over a week and she hasn't responded. For all I know she has Uncle Ed hiding in her hedges with a shot gun scanning the night for virgin stalkers. So that bombed.

Also I have family members and coworkers who are fairly convinced that I am homosexual. I am 33, have good health, a college degree in computer science, like artistic things, get bored-to-death watching sports on TV, so this equates to being homosexual for them.

A few of the people I am close to seem to understand. I know of two other virgins; a 27 year old male, and a 30 year old female. Sometimes an unfortunate woman will find out and start circling in on me.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Any thoughts about cultural attitudes towards <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">virginity</span>?</span>
I wish virginity were more of a category within the social mind. For instance, if I say I like Alternative Rock people can categorize that, Trance yeah they've heard it, J-Pop gets some blank stares, but go much beyond that they try to cram you into some category they are familiar with, regardless if it has anything to do with you.]]></content:encoded>

I've worked many different jobs. Usually it is the lower class, lower paid jobs where there is much talk of sexual bravado. Many guys talk about Friday from 5pm to early Monday morning being one long porn movie. The guys who don't participate in the bravado are looked upon as unmanly, gay or inexperienced.

Being tight-lipped will get you this reputation. This is a form of sexual harassment many men must endure that really isn't talked about in society. Even if they lose their virginity at 18, they will hear boasting in the locker room at 16 and feel either left out or try to make something up to fit in.

Most of this bragging is about status and power. It's kind of like someone driving an SUV to "prove" they have value. You can see in many of the posts of older male virgins the cruelty they have been subjected to. There is inequity and power play between the haves/have nots.

I remember other males boasting about sex. My feelings were very different. Even though I love sex there were and are many awkward moments. You'll never hear a guy bragging about the difficulty about getting a condom on, awkwardness about different positions, trouble getting in there or sliding out in the throes of passion, coming too soon etc...

Ironically, I didn't feel more masculine/powerful after losing my virginity. First time was awkward and I was happy to have it over with, like finishing finals at school. I did not have any male friends to discuss the experience with. Obviously I did not discuss with my family. I did not have any contact with the girl afterwards.

I felt that skydiving was more of a step towards manhood and realized that I had done something most men and woman will never try. This is somewhat elitist, I also somehow feel more "experienced" when discussing the use of psychedelic drugs to someone who has never tried.

Now I realize I have ranted....

I was trying to get to the point that sexuality is a measure of power in some circles. It seems that sex is easily had via prostitutes/one night stands etc. Though I have indulged in this lifestyle without guilt or serious consequences, I do not recommend it.

Now something much rarer is love and acceptance. The only human who loved me was my long-gone grandmother. Most people try in vain to find this in relationships.... My parents had a bitter marriage. The virgins fear they are missing out on sex and closeness to another. My experience is the sex part is easy, the closeness part I might not have in this life.

There is an excellent G'N'R video where Axl Rose comes off a bus stop with a straw of hay in his mouth; presumably coming from a small town where he had no friends and his family misunderstood him. After a few years in the "jungle" he would've experienced things that people in his small town can only imagine. That has kind of been my path in life.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello Readers!

I'm re-posting this very popular item to share this comment below and let everyone know that we are<em> very</em> interested in hearing from older virgins. There are a lot of you out there, and we'd love for you to share your stories, either on the blog or in our upcoming film.

<blockquote>
"I was surfing the net and I found your 'How to Lose Your Virginity' film website. I wanted to let you know that this subject is very personal to me because I am a 38-year-old virgin female (No lie). I know your film is meant for teenagers and people under 30 but keep in mind there are adult virgins over 30."</blockquote>

Please check out our <a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/category/first-person/">First Person</a> series. If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong>. We'd love to run it in this blog! (It's cool if you want to be anonymous on the blog!) We're also looking for people to be in the <a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/about">documentary</a> (and we have ideas on keeping you anonymous for that, too).

Or leave a comment below (we already have 120!)
Thanks for supporting the blog with your ideas and comments!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm under 30, but I think that it is kind of a weird thing to still be a virgin when you're in your mid 20's.  I know women who have and are still virgins, but they have those strong religious ties.  I don't really have those reasons anymore (I did when I was teen, and I signed this stupid card that said I would only kiss boys "Lightly" whatever that means.  Oh, and sex was out of the question).<br/><br/>  Since I've figured out that I'm bi, I would love to have sex with someone I actually like, no matter the gender. <br/><br/>But I'm still a virgin because I'm really shy, really scared, and I have a hard time getting close to people physically, not even on a sexual level.  Also, I've always been focused on what I've been doing right now, not on relationships.  (True story:  Broke up with my first boyfriend because he'd rather snuggle than let me do homework.)<br/><br/> It's weird, but you get to the point to where you lie about sex for your friends or smile and nod at their stories, like you know where their coming from (no pun intended) when you have no idea what's its like.   It's expected that you've had sex, and if you haven't, you must be really religious...or have vagina dentata.  <br/><br/>I've gone on pretty long about this now, and I'm sure you've heard it before. I just thought I'd share.  Can't wait for the movie.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm also a 38 year old virgin (male). The reasons why I am a virgin are complex.  There is not just one reason but many reasons thats have combined over time.  In some respects I am virgin by choice but in other respects its not by choice but I guess ultimately it is by choice.  What I mean by that is that I have always wanted to have sex for the longest time (although not just with anyone). I have always thought about sex and having a relationship but for a good part of my adult life I have kept myself out of the market? Why? Well aside from the fact that I have always been shy I have had economic problems which I realize make me much more unmarketable when it comes to dating/relationship and so on (strike one).  As a result of that I have been living with my parents for most of that time (strike two).  I am sure those two combined makes me a loser in the eyes of many women.  I am also an older virgin male which of course has a tremendous amount of stigma to it (strike three).  Of course its not like I have a sign stapled to my forehead that says "I am a 38 year old virgin" but I am operating under the assumption that lack of dating/relationship/sexual experience will show itself out in time anyway.  Of those the economic one is probably the biggest factor in explaining why I am still a virgin and have never had a girlfriend.  I came close to having a girlfriend 10 years ago but I was unemployed and she was 7 years older than me.  She was looking for a husband and suffice to say that basically she did not see me as husband material because of my economic situation but it was good experience because it made me realize that there are other things women really consider other than personality, physical attraction, etc..  Now at the same time I realize in order to make progress<br/>in this area I have to meet people to increase my social network but I am also very reluctant to meet people.  Why? because meeting people means they learn about me which in turn means they get to know these things about me that I rather hide from people(like my virginity, employment status and living with my parents) just to avoid the potential of people gossiping about me and my unique circumstances.  So it an obvious catch-22. <br/><br/>Nor do I think I am the stereotypical virgin.  I posted my pic on hotornot and got a 7.6 which is at least average.  I am 5.11 and around 190-195 pounds and put much much effort in keeping myself in shape but nevertheless here I am a 38 year old virgin and I will be very very surprised if I every lose my virginity let alone marry or have a girlfriend even though I would like to get married or have a girlfriend.  I really think I will die an unmarried virgin without ever having a girlfriend.  I don't see my economic situation improving much if at all.  If it does then maybe I will have a chance but even then I doubt it.  This is something that I know many might find pathetic and/or something to mock or patronize but to me this is something that deeply saddens me to the point (at times) of great depression.]]></wp:comment_content>

I found this site looking while contemplating the fact that my 25 year-old Christian boyfriend doesn't share my values.<br/><br/>Yeah, yeah, I know everyone thinks I'm repressed by my religious leaders. People who aren't virgins just can't understand, so I keep the matter private.<br/><br/>The one thing people don't seem to talk about is the core of strength that comes with being chaste over the long haul--especially if you give yourself license to feel your sex drive rather than repress it.<br/><br/>I have no problem being who I am. I only wish there was more freedom to discuss the chaste lifestyle without weirding people out.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm a 38 yo male virgin. Awkwardness/shyness of my youth - so I have no one to blame but myself. That eventually lead to the lack of experience that brought me to where I am today.<br /><br />I went to college, have a great job, run/hit the gym twice a week, volunteer, etc. But after decades without a date, nothing holds joy anymore. Ive given my last penny from my 'emotional bank account' long ago without making any deposits.<br /><br />As I look back, the burden has grown to be too much. All my friends have families. They MUST talk about me... I'm too old to 'begin dating' - If I could think of a way to do myself in without my family knowing, I would do it tomorrow.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[28 year old male virgin. I see sex and relationships as destructive forces in my life and seem to lose more friends than gain them because of sex alone. I am happy to be single and alone and have no quarrels with remaining that way until I die. I&#39;ve never been in a serious relationship so I have no idea what I&#39;m missing and ignorance is bliss. At times I lie about my sex life not so much out of embarrassment but that most people I know lack the ability to understand where I&#39;m coming from. Plus, they&#39;re not worth having something to gossip/laugh about. I think sex and being in love are the two most overrated factors ever. The only love that matters to me are the love I have for God and my family and that&#39;s all I need.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well I&#39;m now a 39 year old virgin guy(was one of the 38 year old virgins above). You know what I find interesting? Well lets put it in context. There was a fairly new UCSF study on older virgins and I noticed one of the comments came from from one of the contributors here on this blog in which the contributor said essentially how older virgins are so ashamed of their lack of sexual status that have to hide this fact from everyone as much as possible which I think is  a very fair observation. But then I was watching a documentary the other day about sexual addiction and the people in the documentary were very open about their sexual addiction. Then there is a new reality show called &quot;Sex Rehab&quot; were minor celebs are very open about their addiction. So is this because society now days is more tolerate and accepting of those with many sexual partners than none? If so what does that say about our society? <br /><br />As for me I&#39;m sure I will be a virgin when I turn 40 and the year after that and the year after and so on although my chances are wee bit better now that I got a job but its only part time. Still have to try and get a full-time job so I can move out of my parents place both of which will hinder my chances in the romance department.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[WOW!! sounds like someone got dumped by a guy and now wants to get back at him big time. Suffice to say if you&#39;re an older virgin guy and you tell a woman(not that it neccessarily means that guy described in the post above was one) be prepared for something like this to possibly happen. Maybe its best never to tell a woman and to lie about it. Yep I think thats the lesson to be had for older virgin males here.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The post above was true.  the comic book store is in one town.  Podunk is not a name of a real town, it is meant to be sarcastic, like Nowhereville, Utah.<br />All the information is true. He told me himself that he had never even been touched by a woman.  He did have serious sexual dysfunction issues.  He did actually ejaculate from barely touching me and from one kiss.  I was the first woman he had kissed.  He also did have a very strange relationship with his sister, including camping trips and sharing a tent together while on these trips, and he also told of their trip to a nudist hot springs.<br />I also did read a study about late virgins not enjoying sex because the vagina is not as tight as their fist, and they have been pleasured so much by their hand that a vagina can&#39;t please them.<br />If you are a late virgin, your best bet is to go for a female who is also a late virgin so you can work out the sex details together.<br />This guy mentioned that I needed to &quot;train&quot; him.  sorry but don&#39;t put this burden on the woman.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[LOL!!!. Please cite this study about Virgins not enjoying sex because the vagina is not enough? Think about it? How would a study like that be conducted? How would they get a large enough sample size to test it? How would they test it exactly? How would they  make the correlation between not enjoying sex and the vagina not being tight enough exactly? Do you see how ridulous this sounds? You must be trolling.  <br /><br />  Beyond that its ignorance in the extreme to take one example(assuming its even true) and then extrapolate that to make a general conclusion about late virgins in general. What you&#39;re doing is the essense of sterotyping. In other words prejudice. But its pretty clear that you have animosity towards this guy and apparently his sister too and thats what is really fueling what seems to be a very bitter wierd vendetta against this guy. I mean seiously what kind of screwed up person would feel the need to post what you posted using his real name on a website like this along with rippping his sister? I say before casting stones on to someone else that you look inside yourself.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Oh about the suggesting of looking for another late virgin.  Ok so how would that work exactly?  To begin with the odds off a older male and older female virgin meeting are fairly remote. Furthermore both the woman  and the man would have to be willing to volunteer that information beforehand.  The point is that suggestion might be a good idea in theory but in practical terms the chances of that happening would be  very remote. In others words it would be quite unrealistic to count on]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[OK I read about the study on a sex therapy website, on a section about late in life male virgins. A sex therapist I think would have a good understanding from working with virgins and trying to help these guys.<br />I don&#39;t see how it is unrealistic to go for an inexperienced woman.  I mean...I think male virgins are overestimating their appeal to women if they think just any hot babe is going to want to go to bed with them.  You&#39;re going to have to realize that you are out of a lot of womens&#39; leagues and go for the overlooked, probably overweight, less attractive women who are inexperienced, also.  Probably these are the women who are more in your league, realistically.  No offense.  But they are probably wonderful inside, many of them anyway, the ones who aren&#39;t too bitter.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Its unrealistic to some extent because of the mathematics involved. There simply are not very many older virgin males and older virgin females so the probability of the one older male virgin and one older female virgin meeting and then on top of that knowing about each others virginity is very remote. Second who said anything about whoever an older virgin loses their virginity to must be &quot;hot babe&quot;? The implication is that every non-virgin woman must be a hot babe. You also have a lot of preconceived sterotypes(bigotry) about male older virgins it seems.  Try to become enlighten and less prejudice. Not every older male virgin fits into your preconceived box(they must be butt ugly and fat) you want to put them into.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I want make a point that Thirty8YearOldMVirgin touched upon and which was perfectly illustrated by this poster who ripped this supposed older virgin by mentioning his name and the city he lives in as well as ripping his sister. Whats the point? I think most older virgins(I think more so males) realize or at least should realize the risks of revealing their virginity to anyone. I mean look what happened here. This poster probably did a google search on &quot;older virgins&quot; with the intention of finding a website like this with the intent to rip this supposed older virgin. Now I think its safe to say this poster told countless people in person about this guy as contemptible and despicable as that is.  Now this is the possible risk an older virgin will face if they tell anyone so why would an older virgin want to tell anyone about their virginity? Well I suppose one reason would be <br />that if sexual competence is dependent on sexual experience and an older virgin was getting romantically involved with someone to the point where sex might be initiated at some point soon then it might be wise to tell the other person about your virginity or else risk having the other person think you were bad at sex(if you were bad at sex) because of reasons not related to your lack of experience.<br /><br />So its a catch 22. Reveal your virginity then risk being humiliated by some blabber mouth coming on a website like this to reveal that information and/or revealing it to other people in person.  Don&#39;t reveal that information before having sex for the first time then risk being  humiliated when blabber mouth reveals how bad you were at sex to others (if you were bad at sex) either in person or on a website like this one.<br /><br />Now do you see how this contributes to the problem? Namely do you see how this would inhibit an older virgin from wanting to lose their virginity that has nothing to do with their physical looks or other factors bigots might have about why older virgins are still virgins? To the blabber mouth who made the contemptible and despicable decision to reveal that guys name to see this?<br /><br />This explains why older virgins might not have a very large social network and if you don&#39;t have a very large social network then the chances of meeting someone are reduced.<br /><br />One solution to avoid this problem might be to only reveal that you haven&#39;t had sex in a very long time should it get to a point where sex might be close at hand. That way blabber mouths can&#39;t foam at the mouth to others about your virginity while at the same time explain your sexual incompetence assuming you would be sexually incompetent.  <br /><br />Of course that would be a lie and I would rather not lie but maybe thats what you have to do. Maybe people are so untrustworthy and deep down so contemptible and despicable (like that blabber mouth on this website that trashed that guy along with his sister) that you essentially have no choice but to lie. It would be nice if you could just reveal that information to someone you had a romantic interest with without having to worry about them revealing that information.<br /><br />You know I wonder how such a blabber mouth would feel if someone knew the # of sexual partners they had in their lifetimes and then revealed that information to people either in person or on a website like this one? Think they would mind? Of course they would but these same hypocrites I guess have no problem revealing equally personal information about an older person&#39;s virginity. Hypocrites.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well OK. You&#39;re a female but you say &quot;boys will be boys&quot; and you haven&#39;t heard at your workplace(school) either.  Yes you&#39;ve heard guys talk but not at work.  Now you say Steve Carrel tries to be &quot;one of the guys&quot; but what you don&#39;t understand (because once again I suspect you&#39;re basing reality on a movie) is that an older virgin would be very wary of doing ANYTHING that might reveal this secret.  Wary to the point of not wanting to be in any any social situations being afraid that it might expose him. So what I am saying is that scene in that movie you talk about is unrealistic. Please basing reality on some stupid movie like is just asinine .  The bottom line is you don&#39;t get that kind of talk at work especially this day and age with lawsuits and so on. I mean come on how could you not know this?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I&#39;ve worked many different jobs.<br /><br />Usually it is the lower class, lower paid jobs where there is much talk of sexual bravado.  Many guys talk about Friday from 5pm to early Monday morning being one long porn movie.  <br /><br />The guys who don&#39;t participate in the bravado are looked upon as unmanly,gay or inexperienced.<br /><br />Being tight lipped will get you this reputation.  This is a form of sexual harassment many men must endure that really isn&#39;t talked about in society.  Most men endure this at some point.  ie, even if they lose their virginity at 18, they will hear boasting in the locker room at 16  and feel either left out or try to make something up to fit in.<br /><br />Even bragging about blowing money at a strip bar would be seen as more manly to those guys.  (To me going to a strip bar is unmanly because a man is giving his power and money over to a woman to tease him.)<br /><br />Most of this bragging is about status and power.  It&#39;s kind of like someone driving an SUV to &quot;prove&quot; they have value.  You can see in many of the posts of older male virgins the cruelty they have been subjected to....<br />There is inequity and power play between the haves/ have nots.<br /><br />I remember other males boasting about sex.  My feelings were very different.  Even though I love sex there were/are many awkward moments, you&#39;ll never hear a guy bragging about the difficulty about getting a condom on, awkwardness about different positions, trouble getting in there/sliding out in the throes of passion, coming too soon etc...<br /><br />I realized also after being in a few fist fights, this is also something talked about with much bravado.  Strangely enough the greatest fear I ever felt in a fight was not being hit.  The scariest part was one time, while winning a fight, I was strangling the guy I was fighting.  His face started to turn color.  I did not know what to do.  Should I let him go, is he going to pass out?  This was when I was still in school.  I never got in trouble over this fight, people gave me more space.  This isn&#39;t something my neglectful father could&#39;ve explained to me.  Perhaps my bullying older cousin would&#39;ve given me a pat on the back.  I didn&#39;t feel like the alpha male but I had competently defended myself.<br /><br />Now onto a different topic-masculinty.<br /><br />Ironically, I didn&#39;t feel more masculine/powerful after losing my virginity.<br />First time was akward, I was happy to have it over with, like finishing finals at school.  I did not have any male friends to discuss the experience with.  Obviously I did not discuss with my family.  Did not have any contact with the girl afterwards.<br /><br />Felt that skydiving was more of a step towards manhood and realized that I had done something most men and woman will never try. This is somewhat elitist, I also somehow feel more &quot;experienced&quot; when discussing the use of psychadelic drugs to someone who has never tried.<br /><br />Now I realize I have ranted....<br /><br />I was trying to get to the point that sexuality is a measure of power in some circles.  <br /><br />It seems that sex is easily had via prostitutes/one night stands etc.  Though I have indulged in this lifestyle without guilt or serious consequences, I do not recommend it.<br /><br />Now something much rarer is love and acceptance. The only human who loved me was my long gone grandmother.  Most people try in vain to find this in relationships.... My parents had a bitter marriage.  The virgins fear they are missing out on sex and closeness to another.  My experience is the sex part is easy, the closeness part I might not have in this life.<br /><br />Thanks for allowing me to share my secret self here.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I&#39;m a 25 year old virgin and while that isn&#39;t as old as some posters on this site it still carries a stigma. Most people my age have had numerous sexual relationships and started at around 15 or 16. I had one relationship like seven years ago that included some under the shirt action, and making out, but I never went further than that with the guy. I have had some weird non-date dates and crushes but nothing more since then. I keep my sexual/romantic inexperience secret because I just can&#39;t handle the jokes or weird looks that someone may give me. I have some hesitancy about sex because of the pain, and this has a lot to do with a medical examination I had from the time of 2-13 years age in which a tube was placed in my uretha to determine if my kidneys were emptying out completely. I had kidney reflux problems, and this very painful and humiliating procedure has made me had issues with any vaginal pain. I can barely go to a gynecologist without immense fear. I would like to trust a guy enough to let him know my fears, insecurities, and emotional trauma associated with vaginal pain, but I just think most wouldn&#39;t be understanding enough to be patient with me. The longer I wait the harder it all will be, and sometimes I wish I had been more reckless in my last relationship just to get it over with already.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I am 42, pretty, very outgoing, and have lots of friends and social activities. I am waiting until marriage to have sex. For many reasons - my emotional health, spiritual reasons, to make a special bond with my future husband, etc. Sex creates a close connection with someone, its not a sport. Yes, it should be fun and playful, exciting, crazy, slow, tender - but with the person you are bonded to for life. (my opinion).<br /><br />I&#39;ve had boyfriends, in fact several for 2 yrs+ and we had great chemistry, and a lot of fun being creative in bed - just not sex. Those guys were ok with my choice, one was a 30 yr. old virgin so it was never an issue. (my experiences). <br /><br />Nice to know there are also some men out there waiting for the special girl. Hope we all find the people who appreciate our choices.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I am a 19 year old virgin.<br />I know that&#39;s not considered &quot;Old&quot; but in my generation it certainly is. I&#39;m pretty sure my own mother doesn&#39;t believe I am a virgin-but nonetheless I am.<br />Although I try to conceal that fact about myself the topic of sex is always intriguing and popping up in conversation.  A lot of questions arise as to why I am in fact a teenage virgin.  I don&#39;t think it should matter in any judgement or characteristic trait.  There is also the never ending &quot;virgin-complex&quot;.  I hate it.  It is the excuse to put down, insult, deny intelligence and depreciate someone by their sex lives.  Often people will not want to share certain thoughts of experience with me because I&#39;m &quot;young, naive and innocent&quot;.  It&#39;s stupid and insulting.  I would like everyone to stop thinking my sex life is the ultimate determining factor in my personality and life experience.]]></wp:comment_content>

I did it!!!!!&quot; I was making lite of my situation when in reality you have no idea how depressed I am. In reality I&#39;m not waiting.  I would think the vast majority of males virgins my age aren&#39;t waiting for marriage but because of various multiple circumstances(its almost never just one thing alone but multiple that combine over time) that either would be seen as deal breakers to the vast vast majority of women(like being a virgin) or understand the risks of letting people get to know you knowing that the more someone knows you the more they might suspect you&#39;re one of those older virgins.  The bottom line is unemployment, underemployment, living with your parents and/or being an older virgin are all seen as unattractive qualities among the vast vast majority of women. Men who fit into those categories understand the situation they are in.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[As an older Virgin who will be 40 in a few months I have fallen in love before and recently have been thinking about a girl in high school that I had a huge crush who I last saw almost 21 years ago. She is married now with 1 or 2 children and a doctor.  She has her own webpage for the company she works for an looks the same way I remember her(like she hasn&#39;t aged at all except she seems to have different color hair. More blond).  Apparently she volunteered at homeless shelters which would be totally consistent with kind of person I remember her as.  I remember her as this very cute, sweet, adorable and wholesome person.  I wanted to ask her out but I didn&#39;t either because I was too shy or because I didn&#39;t get to know her until the very end of the last year in high school(she was one grade below me).  Some people used to make comments along the lines of how naive she was I guess because how friendly, open and uncynical her personality was.  Well 20 plus years later I&#39;m the one that still the virgin not her.  Who would have known. Oh well she was too good for me and deserved someone better than myself. <br /><br />Actually that wasn&#39;t the one who I fell in love with. That one in retrospect turned out to be quite dishonest in many ways.  Google her name and you she comes up in these running competitions(12k, 50K, ...) and the age listed for her is 10 or 11 years younger than she actually is. At the time I fell for her I was 28 and unemployed and so that created a problem especially given that she was 35 at the time(her real age).  Never transitioned into a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[OK, I don&#39;t tell many people but I&#39;m a 38 year old virgin Male.  Ever since I can remember I always wanted a wife and children.  I&#39;m a catholic and was brought up to believe that you only have sex if you are committed to each other.  I realize this situation is my own fault but I HATE it. I see my friends and siblings get married and have children and I envy them so much.  I had a good friend that was girl in my early 20&#39;s.  I loved her but she only saw me as a friend. I was too hung up on her to end the friendship and try to find a real relationship.  It turned out to be a colossal waste of time. <br /><br />I have always been a very shy person.  My story is similar to one of the other 38 year olds post.  I was always self conscious with low self esteem.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because a gang of kids used to chase and beat me up everyday as a child because they thought my family was rich (in actuality they only thought that because we weren&#39;t on welfare). Maybe I was just born self conscious.  Because of the beatings I never went outside as a child.  I became a major introvert.  I had few friends but I could never play in front of my house because of the gang of kids.  My family finally moved when I was 12.  It was a breathe of fresh air but I still felt uneasy around people.<br /><br />I never had a girlfriend.  I always tried to be the &quot;nice guy&quot;.  I would bend over backwards to help people.  I thought that if I showed women that I wasn&#39;t like all the other &quot;jerks&quot; then they would see how special I am.  I was only kidding myself.  I would put women on pedastals and be too shy to approach them.  <br /><br />The extent of my sexual experiences are that I bought 2 blow jobs from hookers. I made out with a girl for the first time when I was 34 (I loved it). In total I have made out with 3 women.<br /><br />The reason I&#39;m still a virgin at 38...<br />1. Too shy (started taking medication for it)<br />2. Lived with parents most of my life. (Major red flag. Moving out next month)<br />3. I cannot sleep with anyone that I don&#39;t feel an attraction to. (Maybe I&#39;m too picky).<br />4. I&#39;m not assertive.<br /><br />I have told several people that I&#39;m a virgin.  I lost a friend over it because he lost respect for me. The other 2 are still my friends thank God.<br /><br />Another guy sniffed out that I was a virgin.  I would never join in when they were talking about their conquests and this one big asshole started getting in my face.  He instinctively knew I was giving off the virgin vibe.  Needless to say he got in my face everytime I saw him.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been to therapists but they pretty much just tell me to get out more. I can&#39;t take it much longer. I can&#39;t die a virgin.  It&#39;s one of my greatest fears.<br /><br />I apologize for the erratic post.  This website opened some old wounds that I thought I had buried.  I guess they weren&#39;t buried deep enough.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[To the 38 year old virgin.  I don&#39;t tell people I&#39;m a virgin because of the backlash it would most likely result in.  Like its been pointed out you need a network of friends to meet people if you want to eventually get a girlfriend (or it helps) but once you tell someone in that network you&#39;re a virgin at your age it probably will create a ripple effect which not only could make you lose your so called friends but because of the way people gossip about such things you may lose potential of exanping your network once people know about your virginity. You know I have thought about this before and maybe one way around it is that you have two different geographical zones. Zone one is the area where you come accross the same people day in and day out. In that zone don&#39;t take any chances which means don&#39;t tell anyone about any of this. Then there is another geographical zone where you can experiment more and take chances. Make this one farther away from where you work and live so if there is a backlash as result of you telling your network in this zone about your virginity you can simply cut the network and zone completly off. Then that means you will have to find another new geographical zone to build your new network but since its farther from where you work and live the damage will be minimial. Of course in this day and age of the internet and people posting smack about people this this is not foolproof(see above for an example of a person who did exactly that to an apparent older virgin in Oregon).  <br /><br />Or you can decided not to tell anyone or even lie about it if someone asks.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Turning 30 in a couple of weeks...on valentine&#39;s day of all days.  Still rolling like mario van peebles...solo. (See imdb.com to get that last joke). I guess I don&#39;t have as many self esteem issuess as some of the other posters, but I still feel like a failure for being a virgin and never being in a relationship. I was raised in a rigidly strict household (south asian) so I didn&#39;t really have a social life per say till college. And I was so far behind/unsure of myself by that point that college came and went with no ladies. Plus at the time I was &quot;looking for true love&quot;...a notion that can be quite damaging to ones prospects in today&#39;s society. I was also busy with school (technical major and went to grad school to boot). Was 23 when I finished school and started work immediately. By this time I felt so far behind everyone else I just couldn&#39;t get myself to be succesful. I mean once I started trying I manged to kiss a few girls and &quot;hooked up&quot; once or twice after getting drunk, but still no sex. Plus I had this feeling that I needed to be on even footing if I were to be in a relationship with someone...which at this point is impossible. I think I have managed to get over that, but I am still so far behind that the task seems daunting. <br /><br />I have been told I am good looking (I&#39;m about 6&#39;1 160 and play tennis and bball pretty regularly, been playing sports my entire life so I am pretty fit) and have a large social circle, all of whom think I am quite funny and witty. I used to get phone numbers from girls regularly, but then either wouldn&#39;t call or would go on one or two dates before my insecurities ruined everything. Regardless of what people say, I still feel like eventually girls will find out and look down on me. <br /><br />I want to get married and do everything that normal people do, but I don&#39;t want any potential partner to judge  me for my lack of sucess. <br />(As a male I feel like we are expected to try and boink everything in sight whereas being a female virgin is slightly more acceptable) Was attempting to date some chick once, she asked how many relationships I was in, I was stupidly honest and admitted I had not beein in a relationship, she found it weird and did not want to have anything to do with me. (Note: I did not mention I was a virgin...but she probably put two and two together). I don&#39;t go out of my way to brag about my conquests or fake being a player to get acceptance...so people sometimes pick up on this and infer things. (I found out friends in grad school would ask if I was a virgin behind my back because I didn&#39;t talk about girls). Needless ot say, it was all kind of annoying.<br /><br />  I am actually quite successfull professionally, which I am very grateful for but at the same time people expect me to have had several relationships as a result. A female friend that I confided in during a weak moment expressed shock at my virginity...which is good I guess but at the same time it puts that much more pressure on me to &quot;perform/take the lead&quot; when I have had zero experience doing that. I am not as depressed about this as I was in my mid 20&#39;s (I mean I figure you can only make yourself miserable so much...plus I recognize that I have had the good fortune to be able to live in a great country with lots of friends and all my basic needs are met, and I recognize that I am more fortunate than so many in this world as a result, but still people talk about sex CONSTANTLY it is kinda hard not to think about being a virgin when all you hear about is sex. I am making more of an effort to get over this and move on with my life. And it is somewhat reassuring to hear about others like me...as selfish as that sounds. Best of luck to everybody I guess.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I&#39;m a 32 year old virgin, and it is no big deal for me. I made a committment to God about twelve years ago, and for the most part, give or take a few adventures in oral sex, I kept it. I&#39;m completely abstinante right now. <br /><br />I think in my early twenties, hormones still raging, it bothered me more. There was a time I didn&#39;t plan to wait. And then I realized how overatted sex is, and so now it really isn&#39;t a big thing. I think I&#39;m pretty sexy. Still, I&#39;ve been told that men can &quot;tell.&quot; Of they can, so what? <br /><br />If I meet the right person, and I get married, then I am sure I&#39;ll have a great sex life. If I don&#39;t there is fantasy. I just really don&#39;t understand what the big deal is.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Fascinating blog.  Well, I am an older (female) virgin.  I find it to be terribly embarrassing and I cringe at the idea of anyone knowing.  I&#39;ve educated myself about sex (the best I can without actually having sex) so I don&#39;t look like an ass when my friends are having conversatoins about their latest conquests.  I&#39;m pretty sure they all know though, but so far they&#39;ve been kind enough not to bring it up.<br /><br />I&#39;m not shy.  I get compliments on my looks and I get approached by men.  I would like to have sex.  Now, yesterday.  In order for that to happen though, I&#39;d have to tell someone my status and risk rejection or, even worse, humiliation.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s difficult to know how to proceed when a man approaches you if you&#39;ve had no experience with relationships.  It&#39;s worsened when we live in a age where virginity is equivalent to leprosy.  I realise that&#39;s an extreme statement, but take a poll of people who&#39;ve told friends they&#39;re virgins and see if you see similarities in the responses.<br /><br />I met a guy about two years ago who I really liked and I felt the attraction was mutual.  Then, during one conversation he made fun of a woman he knew who was very interested in him.  He thought she was weird for being in the V-Club.  She was a great deal younger than I was at the time.  I figured if he thought she was strange, there was no way I was saying anything.<br /><br />I&#39;ve made some peace with things as they are.  I feel like I have no other choice.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well I officially became a 40 year virgin this week. Not giving the specific date (don&#39;t want to give any clues just in case anyone stumble upon this site that knows me).  I don&#39;t know what to say. When I was in my early 30&#39;s I thought if was 35 and still virgin I would then kill myself. Well I didn&#39;t and didn&#39;t when I turned 40 although I did think about it. Well so I suppose when I turn 50(assuming I reach that age) I will still be a virgin.  Well here I am still.  Need to first somehow find some consistent employment if thats possible in this economy and with my big resume gaps. Then if I can do that have to find some woman that will not hold my employment problems and virginity at my late age against me. Good luck with that.<br />Always dreamed about at least having a girlfriend.  Guess thats not going to probably happen. Damn how I wish time machines existed. If there was one I could go back in time and just start over.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[good question. Well first of all there isn&#39;t just one reason that can explain my situation but having said that I think one big one is my employment situation. I made a decision a long time ago to go into computer science(I have a degree in that). It turned out to be a bad field for me for many different reasons so in retrospect I would at least either go into a different field or combine it with something else. I don&#39;t if that would make a difference but thats at least one concrete thing I would do differently]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Oh and let me just add that I realize the response could be &quot;well whats stopping for going to a hooker. That wouldn&#39;t explain not going to a hooker&quot;.  My idea of having sex wouldn&#39;t going to a hooker.  Also for me I would at least want to get to know the woman I was having sex with on some level so that would rule out one night stands from say picking a woman up at a bar (and the whole bar thing probably wouldn&#39;t be my thing any way as if I would have a clue about picking a woman up at a bar in the first place. ya right)]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello wonderful commenters. We&#39;re so glad this particular post has become a place where people can share stories and get support. <br /><br />So, moving forward, we have two questions:<br /><br />1. Would you be interested in getting some kind of a discussion board up and running on the topic of older virginity (and does anyone know how to build one?)<br /><br />2. Does anyone want to contribute their stories to First Person? We occasionally run some of the comments as First Person posts, but it&#39;s nicer when we do a fuller interview (anonymously). You can see the whole collection here: http://bit.ly/1YnZ6W]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Interesting blog. I&#39;m a 41 year old male virgin. People tend to want to categorize others into a nice neat and easy to deal with stereotype. It&#39;s obvious that nobody can be categorized me when it comes to virginity. LOL.<br /><br />When the subject comes up I just lie about it... its easier that way. Besides it&#39;s nobody&#39;s business anyway and I tell them so. I&#39;m not that shy, decent looking, not gay, very well educated... yada, yada, yada... people just can&#39;t figure me out. <br /><br />I live in a very rural area, grew up in a rural area so I&#39;m use to it... but there just aren&#39;t any smart, interesting single women in rural areas... most of them move out as soon as they can. That just leaves the women who are dependent... which I find annoying to have to deal with. As far as I&#39;m concerned it could be the vacuum of space regarding women &amp; dating... etc. where I live. Had I know this when I moved here for my job, I may have done things differently, but either way it is what it is... I&#39;m not about to give up everything I&#39;ve accomplished and a good job to move to an area where there are more people, more stress... etc. I work from my home and cover a territory, so it tends to be very busy at times.<br /><br />Categorizing virgins into a stereotype seems silly to me... a lot of people seem to be doing this here.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I&#39;m a 23 year old female, still a virgin, and about to give it up to a guy I just met. <br /><br />Although I have had a couple of opportunities to lose my virginity, I used to think sex was a powerful, mystical act and was afraid due to religions reasons, lack of experience, maybe being too picky, and a low self-esteem. Now after a few years of always being too busy for relationships, I&#39;ve kind of gotten over looking for Mr. Right. Sex isn&#39;t the problem anymore. It&#39;s getting over all my emotional hurdles stemming from insecurity and fear. <br /><br />Although I know sleeping with a guy right away is not going to get me a relationship, I&#39;m okay with that. I just know the longer I wait, the more I will be afraid of it. I don&#39;t believe anymore that the first act of sex is a life-altering, turning point of some sort. It&#39;s just another step in exploring my sexuality. I could be wrong, but I also don&#39;t want to look back years later regretting I couldn&#39;t gather the courage to just have sex. <br /><br />Any advice?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[38(M) and a virgin. <br /><br />Reasons? <br /><br />1. Well I know I&#39;m very shy around girls. <br />2. I don&#39;t have a job and have never really had one because I never really needed one.<br />3. Live with Mom.<br />4. Made no effort.<br /><br />Add them up and you see the &quot;problem&quot;.<br /><br />About 10 years ago I was getting antsy to just go wherever but then my father died and mom needed someone to help her with daily life. Most of the stress etc of that is over but it took about 7-10 years of my life. *poof*<br /><br /><br />I found myself recently checking dating sites and such but I&#39;m going to have to build up the confidence to go beyond merely looking.<br /><br />I think overall its not a choice  most of us simply floated through period of life and woke up one day at 38 or whatever.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Mr. Brightside,<br /><br />I found your article so helpful, that I have to comment on it - Thank you. I find my case to be extreamly similar to yours. I am also raised in a South Asian family and had no girls in school. I studied intense mechanical engineering which kept me busy thorought my college life.<br /><br />Now I am professionally successful, earn decent amount of money and have a good job. But somehow I have not achieved any success with getting laid. I am healthy and atheletic, 27, and play squash in local circuit. As part of my job, I get to meet a lot of women - I work in sales and business development - but still no success. but still, I think I miss something that makes one understand the women. The reason I feel is in my upbringing.<br /><br />My parents never stayed together, and my dad passed away when i was very young. I grew up with my mom &amp; maternal uncle who again never married and was a virgin his whole life. Somehow, i never saw an interaction between a man and woman. Even though I am not shy, this lack of understanding makes me immature in these cases.<br /><br />I am now in mid 20&#39;s and my sexual desires are on their top. I am getting deeply frustrated and depressed - in fact now I am at work and still thinking about the same issue. I don&#39;t when it is going to end. I feel as if I have lost myself as well. It was a kind of support that there are others like me as well, although it is not going to solve my problem.<br /><br />But anyhow, Thank you for posting your cases too.<br /><br />God bless,]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[NECKHILL REDBILLY,<br /><br />Nice website, very interesting!!  Anyway I&#39;m a 29 yr old virgin.  I have only made out with 5 girls and none of them more than once!!  And by &quot;makeout &quot; i mean strictly kiss the girls, I didn&#39;t get or perform mutual masterbation or do anything orally.  This frusttrates me!!  <br /><br />I am waiting for the right girl, but how many are left that are at my level???  I take pride in being a virgin, but my pride is waining in the area of stimulation without sexual intercourse or orally!!  <br /><br />Maybe my pride will get in the way of ever finding a girl?? i certanintly hope not!!  But it will turn me off of a girl if I know she performs orally or gives our regular &quot;handies&quot; without care!!  So I&#39;m debating on whether I should seek out everyhting except intercourse just so i can have a an even playing field??  <br /><br />My friends say I&#39;ve done everything right and i should wait for sex, but then they say &quot;i don&#39;t know why you haven&#39;t at least had a hand-job???You are almost 30!!!!&quot; It&#39;s not very uplifting.<br /><br />I could go on for hours, but i&#39;ll quit for now.<br /><br />p.s. at least I ain&#39;t alone, but my lack of touching may indeed be very rare]]></wp:comment_content>

All my friends my age or older are married and I feel so alone sometimes. Does anyone know of a support group for virgins? The church does not address your needs as an unmarried single and I am tired of getting lumped in with the high school and college kids. :-(]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I&#39;ve heard that kind of sentence before -- multiple times, in fact. It usually pops up in the middle of a screed by some manly Internet man who feels oppressed by society, feminism, political correctness, etc. (read: tiny penis) who rails against &quot;Western women&quot; and all the power and privilege he thinks they think they have. He blames these women -- likely using language I will not dignify by repeating -- for his loneliness (forced, he might say), complaining that all women want is to find a sugar daddy and bleed him dry (or some such nonsense) and that they would never give the time of day to a hard-working, regular guy like him.<br /><br />Invariably there will be talk of this poor, put-upon fellow looking to South America, Asia or Eastern Europe to find himself a &quot;proper wife&quot; who respects &quot;family values&quot; and knows how to be a &quot;real woman.&quot; Having found himself a meek, domesticated woman who knows her place (in the home, no doubt), our hero returns home with his quarry in tow, ready to enjoy all the sex, companionship and home-cooked meals those nasty &quot;Western women&quot; have denied him all this time.<br /><br />The woman (Yahweh help her) is a means to an end, of course -- cook, clean, put out, have kids, raise the kids and make sure not to bother the Man of the House when the game is on. Such a lovely couple, the neighbors say, but why does she always flinch so much when they&#39;re together?]]></wp:comment_content>

Im not gay, not religious or been sexual abused, im in college, have friends, I live on my own, work, have a car, and if i do say so myself I am 5&#39;6&#39;&#39;medium built thick black woman that loves to cook, so for any man or woman out there who feels they are alone or ashamed, don&#39;t be, you are always special and never forget that.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi y&#39;all,<br />I too am a older (slightly - 26 year old) virgin and I really just wanted to say a big THANK YOU to everyone who has taken the time to post on this blog.<br /><br />All of my close friends (and my older siblings) are very frank about their sexual activities and it&#39;s always been a source of confusion between us about why I am still a virgin. <br /><br />Although it&#39;s not for me. I have to sympathise with quite a few of the posters here, that I&#39;m very shy in meeting new people, and I tend to &quot;deer in headlights&quot; when it&#39;s brought to my attention that a man (i&#39;m straight) is interested in me. I didn&#39;t really have a chance to tryout romantic relationships before university due to self-confidence issues and now, well I just haven&#39;t met anyone who interests me enough I guess.<br /><br />When I was younger I toyed with the idea of just letting myself get picked up by someone, but to me, I&#39;m a bit puritian about how sex and love should go hand in hand, I just can&#39;t see the point if there isn&#39;t any interest in pursuing a relationship. <br /><br />I&#39;m pretty confident that eventually I&#39;ll find someone who interests me enough, but really thank you! &#39;Cause I&#39;m sure that for all of us it&#39;s seemed like we&#39;re the &quot;0&quot; bunny from that &quot;everyone else has had more sex than me&quot; bunny video... And when all your friends are laughing, well it kinda sucks, eh?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I haven&#39;t seen this film, nor do I plan to.<br /><br />About the only thing that reading this site and these posts have done is make me insanely grateful at only being 26. I have failed at everything teenage and childish so now that ladies have been pounded like nails I might be able to get a good teacher! FUCK waiting till marriage, but waiting just for someone &quot;right&quot; seems to be bullshit too..<br /><br />I am not religious and frankly the invisible fascist can go fuck himself anyway. Thanks for making me this way, bang up job you can eater. Go make some more slaves, born dirty, to tell you love oh lord and saviour with your silken sponge heart and sinister exaggerations. I&#39;ve already lived through hell because everything is on the other side of the window, LET ME THROUGH ALREADY<br /><br />If I&#39;m still a virgin at 27 and I did not try an adequate amount to alleviate my mind some then I&#39;m paying to get my dick sucked. This is bullshit. How many unbathed, immobile, not working peons have I seen get friction on their flesh; uncountable. To actually have enough sense of self to just DO IT, FOR YOURSELF, I guess I really do hate myself. Or I did. I&#39;m tired of that.<br /><br />I&#39;m sooooooo beautiful yet we GET OLDER AND ALONER. I think I will actually make a real attempt to try and meet virgin women. They are the ONLY ones who could possibly understand how I feel even though I&#39;m positive their reasoning will be far different than mine. OUR ROADS WILL MEET AND THEN I WILL MEAT YOUR ROAD.<br /><br />Ha. That felt good to type.<br />Being a man might actually be fun if I can ever wake up..]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I met my fiance on an online dating site, and it turned out we were both virgins in our mid 30s. While we both had a lot of friends and such all our lives, are decent looking and successful, we both were a bit shy in love and believed in waiting for marriage. The longer you wait for the right person, often the harder it is to believe it&#39;ll ever happen. I started to think something was wrong with me -- that maybe I was fundamentally &quot;broken&quot; in some way. It was then I realized it wasn&#39;t the sex part that was difficult... it was the emotional intimacy that was, and always had been, hard to accomplish. To let myself get really close to people, even friends, was often a vulnerability I couldn&#39;t afford (at least I thought). But when I turned 35, I decided to change my attitude, get out there and get going because I was determined to find a good man. And just three months later, a wonderful, handsome man with a beautiful heart found me online. A few dates later he revealed he was a virgin, much to my amazement, and it was a relief to both of us as I was too. In a few months, we will be married after two and a half years of dating. I&#39;ve never been happier and I&#39;m so glad now that I will have waited for the right person. <br /><br />To everyone who thinks it can&#39;t happen, it CAN. Do what you need to to make your life and yourself better and be persistent in finding love and a good person. Someone once told me, &quot;In order to find the right person, you have to BE the right person.&quot; And I think that is very true. God bless.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I am a 31 year old male, and I am still a virgin.  As it is with other commenters here, there are many reasons for this that stem all the way back to my childhood.  events that accured, and the way that I was treated by my parents, sibblings, and classmates, throughout the years, all build up to my current state of being. I am not an ugly person physically, but my self confidents level tells me that i&#39;m not an attractive person.  I&#39;m also not an ugly person mentally.  I am very confident in saying that I am a very nice person.  I have many friends, both male and female. I have no problem being myself with my friends aside from not letting out my &quot;Secret&quot;.  My &quot;Problem&quot;, is with people i am not flamiliar with.  Meeting new people I have some sort of subcontious way of going to a sort of defence mode.  I pull away, my brain pretty much shuts out all other people around me.  I suddenly have nothing to say or talk about.  I feal uncomfortable and out of place, and I just want to leave.  <br />     I&#39;v never really did much looking around to see if i&#39;m strange for being a virgin befor.  So i just put it in a search, and this site was listed as a result.  I read some of the posts and now I see i&#39;m not the only one.  I see that other people are in the same sitiation, wiether it be by choice or not.  And for that, thank you for this site, and if i can offer you any more info that would be helpfull to you, i&#39;d be more than happy to give it.]]></wp:comment_content>

I either have never attracted a woman or do not have the ability to recognise that someone is atracted to me. I bascally gave up after every woman i saked out in college and high school either laughed and never spoke to me again or just got away and never spoke to me again. One young woman took me home one night when i was 28 and promply freaked out because apparently i didn&#39;t know how to kiss. From then on i not only fear failure but also success. How many times a minute does a man think of sex? that&#39;s the number of times i remember i&#39;m a pathetic freak]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[To the 38 year old virgin above. Here is the thing about that young woman. Do you think she kept that incident between you and her a secret or did she blabber it out to her girlfriends or anyone that happens to know the two of you? You see this is one of the reasons this makes your situation(and mine since I&#39;m a tad bit older than you in the same situation).  Networking is vital if someone wants to progress forward romantically but in our case networking is very risky in our situation. We need to take chances to solve this problem but who can you really trust with this very personal information.  while I don&#39;t know you I would wager you&#39;re not a loser but what you probably interpret as you being a loser is you reacting to a large segment of the society just being blatant bigoted and prejudice to those who just happen to be older virgins. I don&#39;t know the solution. I don&#39;t.<br /><br />BTW are you unemployed because if you are that would makes things just that much worse.]]></wp:comment_content>

What age range of a woman <br />would or should he consider? Something<br />around his age like say 35-45 like most men<br />would? OK So lets try this out. Let say he <br />starts dating a woman and after some dates <br />it gets to the point that he finally gets to <br />Kiss the woman and thus being his first Kiss <br />ever.<br /><br />Now are first kissed always awkward for almost <br />anyone? Ok lets just assume they are and so the <br />older virgin kisses the woman and its awkward <br />and the woman realized he has never kissed a <br />woman before even though he is 40. Is there any <br />doubt in anyone&#39;s mind that the vast vast <br />overwhelming majority of women experiencing that <br />situation would freak and then would have <br />absolutely no romantic interest in that 40 year <br />old virgin regardless of how much she was into <br />him before the dreaded first time kiss?<br /><br />Furthermore the likelihood that she will keep <br />this incident to herself and not tell all her <br />girlfriends about it even if it includes people <br />the older virgin also knows is very remote I would <br />assume? If so and she decides to gossip about it <br />that would make for some very awkward and humiliating <br />situations if the older virgin runs into these <br />people at least regularly like at work.  So therefore <br />from the standpoint of networking the older virgin <br />has to be really careful about who he considers <br />when dating. They can&#39;t know anyone he knows unless <br />its someone he can really trust(Like older married<br />person who would less likely to gossip about such <br />things rather than say a younger single person).<br /><br /><br />So would the solution to this date much younger <br />women? Ya right. That&#39;s not going to work either. <br />Younger women generally aren&#39;t going to be into <br />older men(unless they have a lot of money) and <br />especially if they are virgins not to mention other <br />problems so that&#39;s not going to work.<br /><br /><br />So in conclusion the older virgins seems to be <br />totally fucked(no ironic pun intended). There is no <br />escape for the older virgin. Their virginity at their <br />age will be known and can&#39;t be hid (unless they decided <br />just to give up on their situation completely and not <br />put themselves out their) and when their virginity is <br />known to whatever woman comes across it will be very <br />very slim that that woman will have any interest in <br />that older virgin regardless of how she felt about him <br />before she found out about his dreaded virginity(worse <br />than leprosy)]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I&#39;ve chimed in on this before, but I personally know two guys who didn&#39;t become sexually active until their late 30s, both with the women they ended up marrying. Neither was religious, but for various reasons, it was something that hadn&#39;t happened yet. <br /><br />Although dating can be incredibly awkward, and not everyone you meet will be respectful, please don&#39;t assume that every woman out there is:<br />a) a lot more experienced than you<br />b) considers your experience any kind of deal-breaker<br />c) has any interest in humiliating you if things don&#39;t work out<br /><br />Please hang in there....there are great people out there.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I am a 35 year old virgin. I have met men that I have felt a physical and mental attraction toward but unfortunately they were snapped up already by women who happened to be far from perfect! In general I don&#39;t think that I am too picky but I do know what I want and just can&#39;t seem to find it anywhere or perhaps am not looking in the right places. I am not a religious freak by any means but I do think that sex belongs in the vicinity of a committed relationship. And I do not judge male virgins to be undesirable, I actually have great respect for a man who can keep it is his pants, things like self-control and having standards are a definite turn-on in my book. It makes me sad to read about how older virgins (men and women)are ashamed of their virginity. The loneliness of not having someone in your life may be hard to bear but the potential that we all have to offer someone an evolved level of love and commitment is something to be proud not ashamed of.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I am a 38 year old male. I have had only one real girlfriend in my life and I am a technical virgin. I would perform cunnilingus on her, and would have mutual masturbation sessions, but never completed intercourse.  My main issue is my penis size. I feel it is too small to properly maintain enough stimulation to maintain an erection and satisfy my partner. To make matters worse, I have a friend who is oversexed. She has slept with 30-40 guys and talks about sex constantly. I became attracted to her, and one drunken night, she wanted to have sex with me, but I backed out of it knowing that she would not be satisfied. She belittles men with small endowment.  I feel like I am in hell.  I want a relationship so badly, and walk around heartbroken all the time.  It just seems that women today will drop you if you have issues with sex, and penis size is hard to correct without dangerous surgery.  If I found a girl I really loved and she left me because of bedroom issues, I would put a gun in my mouth.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[My guess is that most women would be very suspicious of anyone claiming they are virgins<br />on the internet and then asking anyone if <br />they want to be their first.<br /><br /><br /><br />Also be aware that should you get any <br />responses there could always be the <br />possibility that their motivation isn&#39;t <br />to have sex with you but to sandbag you. <br />There was one poster on here(administrator rightly deleted post) who knew an older <br />virgin from Oregon.  No sex was involved <br />but this woman gave out his name, dissed <br />him and humiliated him once she found out <br />he was an older virgin. <br /><br />So just keep that in mind<br /><br />of course it would be near impossible to communicate when posting Anonymously]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Look all you virgins out there.  You need to go out and date.  That is how you gain experience.  It does not need to lead to sex, and the more you date the more comfortable you will feel around the opposite sex, so when the time comes you won&#39;t even feel any kind of pressure or anxiety.  It is supposed to come natural because it is programmed into our brains to procreate.  You learn to walk before you run and that adage holds true to everything in life including sex.  <br /><br />And please stop with the self-defeating attitudes.  This attitude will not only infect your sex life but spread to the rest of your life as well.  It&#39;s like a poor person saying he/she will never be able to afford something instead of trying to figure out a way to one day afford it.]]></wp:comment_content>

In some ways, I felt like I had waited so long to have intercourse that I didn&#39;t want to have it with my first boyfriend despite my age.  Now, I wish I had.  I haven&#39;t had a boyfriend since.  Anyway.  Life goes on.  Hopefully a boyfriend and intercourse is my near future!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[31 year old male virgin here. I just turned 31 last week. I think what did me in was shyness as a teen. I also had somewhat religious parents made us go to catholic church occasionaly. Sex before marriage was wrong. Well I grew older parents became less religious dad became alcoholic.<br /><br />I came to despise alcohol and drugs to this day. I cannot stand to be around anyone while they are intoxicated. I was invited to parties I never went because I knew people would be drinking. I met girls in high-school but to me they were immature for me. I had a good friend who I though would become the one. We got pretty close but she was very anti social we hardly went anywhere public. Usually we sat at a park and talked or sat in the car and talked.<br /><br />In the end it didn&#39;t work out because of her anti social ways I could not deal with it. I&#39;d rather be single than have been with such a anti social female. I guess in the end the main reason for me being a virgin in my protecting parents. Then the alcoholism sealed the coffin I can&#39;t find a woman who feels like me about alcohol. My father and I hardly talk anymore.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I&#39;m a divorced 37 yr old woman dating a 40 yr old virgin man. I am the first woman he has kissed, the first real relationship he has had. He&#39;s a little shy, but incredibly kind and treats me better than any man I&#39;ve ever dated. We both attend a &quot;wait until marriage&quot; church, so my only sexual experience is with my ex-husband. My problem in marriage - our desire levels did not match - I wanted far more than he did. My concern in dating a 40 yr old virgin is that if we marry and become intimate, I will have the same problem I did before. Is it possible for a man to stay a virgin so long and still have a high sex drive?? Or am I dooming myself to the same fate I had before if I stay with him??]]></wp:comment_content>

If sex drive can be measured by how many times one<br />masturbates then I would say I have a very <br />high sex dive. Then again I suppose a <br />counter argument to that would be how would <br />I know what is a lot of masturbation? I guess <br />I wouldn&#39;t know since that would assume that there has been a study to measure such a thing(good luck finding such a study). But <br />sure seems like I think a lot about sex <br />as strange as that may sound coming from a <br />40+ year old virgin.]]></wp:comment_content>

I&#39;m not attractive in the slightess and I was late going through puberty (4 yrs after everyone else my age). This definately had an affect on me as females didnt show any interest in me until my mid/late 20&#39;s. By this time I was so nervous at the thought of sex that I developed a phobia/anxiety of being intimate and thus getting an errection is pretty much none existant when its required.]]></wp:comment_content>

Do you think that&#39;s because you&#39;re a<br />Woman rather than a Man? Do you think there is<br />less of a stigma for a woman to be an older virgin than a Man?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[38 year old male here.  Like two other posters, was born &amp; raised in the U.S. by immigrant parents from South Asia.  They spent most of the time arguing, hurling profanity at each other, and the occasional smack by my dad.  So, they were not an example of a healthy relationship.  I went off to college thinking I would be different, but what I did not realize, is that unless you have certain essential qualities, the other stuff like kindness and courtesy won't get you laid.  I was skinny with thick glasses.  I did improve my physique (I have a runner's build, but have never exceeded 145 pounds) while I was in college by exercising regularly and eating healthy, but the glasses were still thick, and my inherited condition did not make contact lenses an option.  As I learned, a woman needs only one reason (good or silly) to not have sex with a man - thick glasses will do just fine.  

I did get close to women, but they viewed me as a confidante, not as a possible sexual partner.  My continuous bad luck with women made me find a refuge in phone sex, which put me into debt.  Since I was already physically unappealing, I thought my debt would make me even more unattractive, so that just meant more phone sex.

Through circumstances, I live with an aunt and uncle, and they are really good to me in a way my own parents never were.  But, since I did not have to pay rent or a mortgage, I simply rationalized it as, "Hey, more money for phone sex."

I hate to play the race card, but as an Indian guy, there seems to be higher standard of sexual suitability for men.  When I was younger, most Indian women would not give me the time of day, and I was invisible to other ethnicities, save for the occasional Asian female classmate/co-worker.

The happiest marriages I see are where the woman has no "real" worries.  Yes, she has the stresses of modern life, but her basic financial position is sound, thanks largely to the efforts of her husband or her father.  Since I cannot provide that financial setup, I am simply not suitable.  

I spend more time than I should thinking about this.  Even if I did come across a woman who would have sex with me, I'm worried that I would simply get angry with her, in the sense that she is throwing charity my way, and knows it.  All the women I have dated or been close to would break off contact once their social/economic condition improved, and they believed they could do better in terms of male suitors.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I am a 37 year old virgin male. I am a virgin by choice. I am straight and my religious beliefs have influenced my decision. I have completed college. I have lots of friends. I have a great job and make good money. I live by myself and have two cats. I have a great family. I have dated and have had girlfriends. I havnt dated anyone in a few months. I kind of feel like I have missed the boat on marriage. I wish I could find a virgin woman to be my wife because I feel like I have waited this long I could find someone like myself. Its just a struggle but I am happy with my life. I just feel like part of my life is missing. Yes. I do lie about sex to avoid answering so many questions. I am glad I came across this site......I want to encourage everyone to keep pressing on. For those who are shy and afraid of being hurt or rejected, stop! Hurt and rejection makes you stronger and makes finding the right one that much more special. Find some friends of the oposite sex and just hang out and have fun. Who knows? One of their friends might just be the one. Sex is just sex. Love is something special. Don't give up on yourself. I have plenty of friends that married late in life and started families. God bless you.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I definitly think for us over 30 V card holders, if we can pull it off, the internet really is totally the best place to meet new people for dating. But, I keep getting these really nice girls chatting, and they just totally flake out on me, time after time... because they arent serious about meeting up... or they're looking for something better than they can get in the real world... and I dont meet the spec, perhaps.   

The internet's good though:

There are no connections to your friends, familiy and co workers, so when you do have to let slip you have zero sexual history... if they run 2000 miles, then they wont have the option to tell everyone your personal business... and belive me, a co worker would certinly do that! I would hate everyone in my company to be talking about me still having my v-card in my 30's... not that I'm terribly ashamed of the real situation... but because people just wont understand it or me... its bad to reveal! I did a search of internet dating profiles using the key word 'virgin', just to see what women might say if they brought it up on their profile... and the results werent good: Almost no references apart from the 40 year old virgin movie... accept one women who said she was chatting to a 25 yr old guy who when he revealed it to her she said she almost threw her laptop in the air and... and I quote her "had to get the virgin germs of her"... just imagine if she was a real person with connections to people you knew. She could do soooo much damage. 


On women being able to smell lack of confidence.... i dont think being a v card holder always = total lack of confidence that is visible to women from a mile. I can see clearly some women like me... but when they show it too clearly it completely freaks me out and i back off.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well, I am a 41-year-old man who is a virgin.   The reasons why range from basically not having any girlfriends in my teens or 20s (lack of opportunity), to family problems (relatives are invasive and an embarrassing situation) , to the simple fact that I am ugly and fat and my health is declining.   

I get along fine with women.  I have had serious friendships.  Just nothing that far. 

Another problem is that I like smart, intelligent people.  Anybody dumb enough to want anything to do with me would be too dumb for me to want anything to do with.  They'd have to have no standards at all, which means they're not intelligent.    This is a major impediment and so I don't even try to find someone any more.  

So I am resigned that it's a lost cause that is not going to change without a trip to a Nevada brothel, and that seems more like a chore than something fun.  The older I get, the less I feel the overwhelming urge to do the deed.  It seems to be true what they say about things slowing down after 40.  

Lately it has finally gone beyond feeling sorry for myself and turned into a realization that I will probably never have kids.   I mean, I knew this before but never really worried about it.  Now it's petty much too late to worry about it.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm 31 years old, and still a virgin. I had a date once when I was 20, and after spending time with her one of my mates who hardly knew her ended up sleeping with her instead. I wasn't angry or anything, but it did make me think.  I had another girl shortly after who allowed me to kiss her when she was drunk, agreed to go out with me, and then before we even went out I was dumped because she figured out I was a virgin (I think it was my nerves).  Both girls were the same age as me.

Anyway, since then I've had a couple of girls show me interest as a friend and nothing more.  These friends have now drifted away, as they are all married and have families, etc. to keep them busy.

The only woman I spend any time with is a married woman from work who I go to the gym with once a week. She flirted with me outrageously for ages, and no it wasn't in my head. She even asked me to take a picture of her in a bust enhancing swimsuit and then sent it to me.  When I decided to make a move recently, she rejected me (just like everyone else!). Judge me if you want because she's married, but I don't really care about anyone's opinion on this. I really thought she liked me, and I tried not to fall for her. I've known her for 6 years, and she's always flirted and teased me. The logical part of my mind knew it was just a way for her to stroke her ego, but I find myself in love with her.

What I realised with this latest rejection, is that it isn't the lack of sex that bothers me. It's the lack of a relationship (which probably eventually leads to sex).

I don't feel special to any woman at any time. I've been crying on and off over her for over a month.  The only other time I've cried that much is when my mother (my only parent) died, when I was 22. I can't control it either - I've even had to rush to the toilets at work because I was bursting into tears. Even then I never felt like I do now. I feel my life is pointless.

The main reason I haven't used a prostitute, because it would be just that. Using. The important thing is that the woman wants me the same way I want her.

I see posts here on living a full life with family and friends instead. I don't have much in the way of family left. I have a few friends that I see once or twice a week.  The only things that keep me alive are family, friends, and football... and fear of being dead.

When you have nobody to share anything with, everything is coloured by it. It's an empty existence. I don't enjoy anything anymore really. I was even sitting at the football (which used to be one of my favourite things) thinking about how she (the married woman) didn't like me, and that I'm probably never going to find anyone.

I know this is a long post, and to be honest it's made me feel worse. I'll tell you something though, I wouldn't wish this on anyone. I thought I felt bad before, but I never thought it was possible to feel as low as I do now, and have done for this past month, and it isn't going away.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I am a 39 yr old male virgin.I've never had a girlfriend or been on date.Im not sure if I can explain why I have no experience with the opposite sex but I'll give it try.I've never been asked out on a date or been flirted with so I just assumed  women are not interested in me.This is one of the reasons why I have never asked out any women.The way I see it,if women were interested in me they would let be known some how.I have no anger or bitterness because of the lack of interest in me by women.I don't really blame them because I wouldn't want to date or get to know me either.Actually I would be turned off if a woman did show any interest in me.Im not good looking and have no personality but Im financially well off.Therefor I would just assume she was either delusional or only interested in my money and not me.None of my family members or friends have ever attempted to set me up on date.I wonder why. I can't see any woman my age not being turned off by my lack of dating (never mind sexual)experience.There is just no point in trying.Dont have any real interest dating or having sex now.I did in my teens and 20's but since I hit my 30's I've lost any desire.I can't really desire something I've never had.I figure if no woman has never been interested in me up to this point,they never will.So why get upset over it.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ha, glad I found this site.  

Well, im 32 yr old virgin.  

I'll say what I know: basically you dont want to reveal virginity because sex (how often you get it) is normally based on how desirable you are to other people. If you havent done it when you're much older then it automatically follows in many people's minds that the massive implication is that you are just not a desirable person... in fact you're down in the bottom 1% or less (just look at that bigotted womens response above about older V's having to settle for unattractive partners to be "realistic"). I told my best buddy in the whole wide world (known him since we were 9) that I still had my V-card, but one night he almost started to blab about it with some of my other friends... starting making sexual references to things and then saying "oh sorry mate you dont know what that means... sorry". In the end I had to seriously warn him not to do that and tell him he was becoming a liability... and only then he understood I didnt want it drawn attention to! I had already asked him not to talk to anyone about it, to which is assured me he totally wouldnt! So, yes you've got to be careful who you tell.   

Truth is there are many reasons for why someone might still be a virgin later. In my case it is massively down to a social phobia that developed and gripped me at age 16. It was so overpowering that I cut myself off from other people... I had started avoiding people and social situations. At age 20 I tried to address it by moving 100's of miles away to university... but although I made a lot of good friends (including 2 very close females friends) and became so much more confident and socially 'with-it', I just couldnt approach women I didnt know well to ask them out or even start a convocation (that's me!). That part of me was still just too shy, and it wasnt even a lack of confidence in myself, it was a sort of purely chemical thing and it was over-powering... I was just too sensitive. I always thought of myself as ok looking though.  

I'm now 32, as I say. I sometimes see women from a distance (not close friends with me) that I can see are attracted to me and often I am somewhat to them... but I dont know how to get from showing interest in someone and actually forming a next step with them. I was first able to show a girl I was interested when I was 23, and before that I would be so inhibited that I was unable to show attraction towards anyone. I've always had a strong sex-drive though and a lot to give.  

I'm off to the docs soon to mention I want some help dealing with my social phobia. I've really done all I could on my own and I've come a long way. I dont know why I didnt just raise it as the main problem 10 years or more ago. I had some counciling for it at 16.. but it was absolutly rubbish! I was terrified at 16 when it hit.]]></wp:comment_content>

She talks to us about her first time, the 'shame area,' and why German teens think about sex differently than Americans.</span></span>

Melora wrote us after reading a piece we did on <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://theamericanvirgin.blogspot.com/2009/12/every-vulva-is-different-which-is-not.html">Bravo Magazine's vulva story</a>. We'll have more from Melora talking about German teens and sex in a future post. Please send us an <a href="mailto:info@trixiefilms.com">email</a> if you'd like to tell your story.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tell us about yourself:</span>
I am a 18-year-old girl from Germany. <span><span>I grew up in a liberal household and my parents talked to me about sexuality. I learned about it in school at primary school and at "high school" (we have a different word for that). In primary school, sex education was more like "When Mum and Daddy love each other …" and so on, how to make a baby, what happened during pregnancy etc. Then in high school we talked about how our bodies change, what menstruation is, what kind of prevention exist and so on.</span></span>

The word "pubic area" in the German language is <span style="font-style: italic;">"Schamhaare."</span> If you translate it directly, it means "shame area." I had a really cool biology teacher in high school who always said: "I do not like it to call it "shame area" because there is nothing to be ashamed about." He gave us a positive feeling about ourselves and our bodies.

When I was younger – 13/14 years old – I started to read the <a href="http://www.bravo.de/online/render.php?render=000050">BRAVO magazine</a>. In Germany it plays a big role in sex education. For many years now, you can write a letter to the Dr. Sommer team and ask everything about sex, relationship and other problems.
<span><span><span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Some science:</span></span></span>
A study of the German Federal Center for Health Education showed that 7% of girls 14-years-old and under have already had sexual intercourse. It was 15% of girls by the age of 15, and 30% by the age of 16 years.</span>

At the age of 17 years, 65% of the girls and 59% of boys had had sex. Of that group, 75% of the boys said their first time was good, but only 59% of the girls did.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tell us about your first time:</span>
I belong to this 30% group: I "lost" my virginity when I was 16 years old. I was really in love with this guy, but it was just a short summer relationship, but not even a relationship. He did not want to have a serious relationship because he moved to another town at the end of the summer. He really broke my heart but nevertheless I never regret that I had sex with him. I just felt that this was the right moment and the right guy.

It was painful and maybe the worst sex I ever had but I did not expected too much from my first time. For me, it was just important that it was the right guy. I really enjoy having sex and for me sex is not always connected with love. It is enough "just" to like the person. Of course, it is nice to have sex with the person you love, but that is not necessary.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How do you define virginity?</span>
It is hard to define virginity because this so-called virginal membrane does not really exist. I think sex is more than penetration because this definition discriminates against lesbians. So I think it is the best is to define this for yourself or even better: <span style="font-style: italic;">You do not have to care about it.</span>

This whole virginity thing is based on an old-fashioned moral: The girl has to keep something very "valuable", her hymen, otherwise she is a "slut." But the boy is cool when he has sex (he has no piece of skin to lose when he has sex).

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How do German teenagers' attitudes towards sex differ from the US?</span>
We do not have this "virginity cult." Actually, I suppose for most of the teenagers it is more important to lose their virginity than to keep it. I know only one person who is waiting to have sex until she marries – and this is more because she is scared of having sex than because of religious reasons.

Most of the people around me do not believe in God, and if they do so, it does not keep them from having sex. Of seven of my closest friends, four of them already had sex, mostly at the age of 16/17, and all of them prevent with the anti-baby-pill. I mentioned one of them wants to stay "clean" until marriage, and two of them just have not f0und the right guy yet.

Check out an article I just did for <a href="http://skirt.com/essays/there-right-way#new">Skirt!</a>, a very cool monthly feminist magazine out of South Carolina. They invited me to write about the disconnect between fantasy and reality in first-time sexual experiences, so I decided to include some of the <a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/category/first-person/">First Person stories</a> we run on this blog. Here's a little bit of it:
<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: trebuchet ms; color: #660000;">I cringe when I think about all the times I nodded and smiled knowingly when college friends talked about sex. At the age of 23, I believed I was the oldest living virgin and everyone around me was having fabulous sex with their devoted boyfriends. In retrospect, I’m sure many were as full of shit as I was.</p>
<p style="font-family: trebuchet ms; color: #660000;">Rosie, 21, echoes the feelings of several women I know: "An older man was willing to give me some attention and make me feel special. It was hard to resist even though I knew the situation was really wrong. I knew I was being taken advantage of, but it was nice to feel wanted."</p>
<span style="color: #660000; font-family: trebuchet ms;">I think "First Person" is popular partly because of the wide variety of experiences and opinions about virginity. We’re fed a lot of crap about what our first times should be like, whether it’s the promise of perfect wedding night sex after a life of abstinence, losing it on prom night with your football player boyfriend, or going wild on spring break while the cameras roll. Reality is something else entirely, so it’s no wonder many of us feel abnormal and then are too embarrassed to talk about it.</span></blockquote>

If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong>. We'd love to run it in this blog!
</span></span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tell us a little about yourself</span>
I'm going on 22 years old. I'm studying Physics and French. I was raised LDS (Mormon), and I still live in Utah. I fall somewhere along the Jack Mormon to agnostic to liberal Christian spectrum. I've had a serious boyfriend since I was 18.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How do you define virginity?</span>
My first reaction would be to think of penetrative sex as being the line, but I see good arguments for the line being elsewhere.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why did you decide to stay a virgin?</span>
Well, here in "Zion," sometimes that choice is made for you! (Har har.) In high school, I had absolutely no physical contact with the opposite sex: this came from a combination of studious nerdiness, pre-pubescence, and strict standards for myself. I mean, I hadn't even held hands!

When I went down to Brigham Young University, I hit adolescence (I'm a late bloomer) and went boy-crazy. I made out with my first boyfriend a lot, but with the proscriptions against being in bedrooms and such, we always kept our clothes on. A different boyfriend I was very crazy about had insane amounts of self-control: we would only kiss. The third guy I dated/was engaged to, we went as far as oral sex, but held out a surprisingly long time (a couple of years). The more disaffected I became with the Church, the more I would do.

And, though it's a bit embarrassing, I attempted to lose my virginity completely with the fiancé. Well, truth be told, he is now my ex-fiancé. We had a very sexual relationship, but no, I did not lose my virginity, as I would define that. We attempted to do so, but literally were not successful. (I think there’s definitely a myth out there that once you know the mechanics of sex, it will somehow be easy or a no-brainer in practice! I’m not stupid: I know how to have intercourse in theory: but it simply didn’t happen on the first try.)

That experience was perhaps somewhat disappointing, but not terribly scarring–I was perfectly willing to just "have at it" again. But then we broke up (over completely non-sexual reasons), so I don’t know if I will "wait till marriage" now. I think once you’re engaged to someone, obviously you picture having sex with them and no one else. So, I highly doubt it will "live up to my expectations;" at this point, though, I’m more concerned with the loss of emotional intimacy.

My sexual life outside intercourse per se has been perfectly satisfying. Let’s just say that I have a hard time comprehending these women that have never experienced an orgasm! But I think that comes down to society’s bias against other forms of sexuality.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How have your partners reacted?</span>
All of my partners thus far have been LDS, and thus did not want to have sex before marriage. They were just as much virgins as me!

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Any general thoughts on virginity in our society?</span>
I have a very high sex drive, and I think it's silly that even secularists act like women aren't sensual, are too "tired" all the time, etc., etc. Also, even though I no longer believe in a Prophet telling me when to say "no," that doesn't mean I'm just going to jump in bed with any schmuck, you know? I still believe in standards, just those that are more self-determined at this point.

As far as virginity in the LDS society, I still do think that you should wait to have sex with a person you truly know and love, but that it is a pretty weak/unreliable determiner of your "righteousness." If you constantly tell someone that something is bad, then they'll develop unhealthy complexes, male or female.]]></content:encoded>

I'm a 25-year-old virgin and while that isn't as old as some posters on this site it still carries a stigma. Most people my age have had numerous sexual relationships and started at around 15 or 16.

I had one relationship like seven years ago that included some under-the-shirt action and making out, but I never went further than that with the guy. I have had some weird non-date dates and crushes but nothing more since then. I keep my sexual/romantic inexperience secret because I just can't handle the jokes or weird looks that someone may give me.

I have some hesitancy about sex because of the pain, and this has a lot to do with a medical examination I had from the time of 2-13 years age in which a tube was placed in my uretha to determine if my kidneys were emptying out completely. I had kidney reflux problems, and this very painful and humiliating procedure has made me have issues with any vaginal pain. I can barely go to a gynecologist without immense fear.

I would like to trust a guy enough to let him know my fears, insecurities, and emotional trauma associated with vaginal pain, but I just think most wouldn't be understanding enough to be patient with me. The longer I wait the harder it all will be, and sometimes I wish I had been more reckless in my last relationship just to get it over with already.]]></content:encoded>

I'm an older (female) virgin. I find it to be terribly embarrassing and I cringe at the idea of anyone knowing. I've educated myself about sex (the best I can without actually having sex) so I don't look like an ass when my friends are having conversations about their latest conquests. I'm pretty sure they all know though, but so far they've been kind enough not to bring it up.

I'm not shy. I get compliments on my looks and I get approached by men. I would like to have sex. Now, yesterday. In order for that to happen though, I'd have to tell someone my status and risk rejection or, even worse, humiliation. Unfortunately, it's difficult to know how to proceed when a man approaches you if you've had no experience with relationships. It's worsened when we live in a age where virginity is equivalent to leprosy. I realise that's an extreme statement, but take a poll of people who've told friends they're virgins and see if you see similarities in the responses.

I met a guy about two years ago who I really liked and I felt the attraction was mutual. Then, during one conversation he made fun of a woman he knew who was very interested in him. He thought she was weird for being in the V-Club. She was a great deal younger than I was at the time. I figured if he thought she was strange, there was no way I was saying anything.

I've made some peace with things as they are. I feel like I have no other choice.]]></content:encoded>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tell us about yourself:</span>
I'm a 25-year-old woman and struggling freelancer from the UK. I write a blog about being a single virgin. I like chocolate.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How do you define virginity?</span>
I was taught during sex education at school is that a virgin is someone who hasn't had penetrative sex, and that is still my personal definition of it. But I have seen discussion that it means <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">someone's</span> experience in a sexual act, which makes sense especially for defining lesbian sex.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why did you decide to stay a virgin?</span>
I was a bit of a late bloomer, my mates were dating and I was off galloping on a horse across the Sussex downs. Admittedly I am not in the Cathrine Zeta-Jones league when it comes to looks. I was very much a wallflower and would sit in a dark corner. Once I got to university I found out how sexual I was. Like any woman, I was still very critical about my looks but became less of a wall flower.

I have had partners (well more like tragic dates) and they never went well. My very first was with a semi-stalker who demanded to know where I was 24hrs a day. The next couple were very insecure and more like children then men, wanting their hand held and wanting someone to wait outside the loos for them.

I did meet a couple of nice men while out drinking with some university mates, but one freaked me out by asking me to be in a "film." Also had my fair share of make-out sessions at the back of the club. It seems I am doomed to get stuck with the bottom-of-the-barrel men.

The one guy I could see myself being with didn't tell me his feelings and returned to Wales after finishing our course. I heard it through one of his mates and by then it was too late.

I have thought about just going out and doing it, but I have friends that lost their virginity at a young age to strangers and their stories of pain were a bit off-putting. I know each person is different but I don't want to be thinking about it while in the act.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How have your partners reacted?</span>
Sadly none stuck around long enough to tell. Most of my friends have been supportive.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Any general thoughts on virginity in our society?</span>
In film and TV they mock a person who is a virgin over a certain age, which as a virgin watching is uncomfortable. In magazines we are bombarded by <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">photoshopped</span> super slender women and muscle-bound men and expected to look like that and be very sexually active.

A few years ago I told some people in confidence that I was a virgin and they used it in a fight to shame me and a guy I was flirting with. Another so-called friend decided to out me to a large group of people. They stood in my defense and respected me for it while she bragged about how much more of a woman she was than me because she bedded a whole ton of men.

To me virginity doesn't make someone less of a woman/man. And we shouldn't be pressured into doing it either just "because." I find it a shame that admitting to being a virgin is something to be feared because you feel like you are being judged.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tell us about yourself:</span>
I am a 26 year old, white, male, heterosexual, college graduate, who is middle class and a virgin. I would say, for the most part, I am a fairly normal, well adjusted individual.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How do you define virginity?</span>
I used to believe that it applied to penetrative sex, unless the kind of sexual act was specified. However, after visiting this site, I see that that definition leaves out people of different sexual orientations. It just depends on the person and the act.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why did you decide to stay a virgin?</span>
Through high school, it was not really a decision. I was not popular and was rather hefty, so I did not date. My mother would have preferred if I had stayed a virgin, and my father didn't really care. While I grew up in a religious household, it didn't feel like virginity was paramount. When I got to college, I dated a girl for the first time, and she was deeply religious. This impacted my view on virginity, and I decided I wanted to stay chaste until marriage.

After that relationship, I dated another girl for a year and a half. We fooled around, but, pardoning the metaphor, never went past second base. This changed after a year, and we moved to oral sex. I had been hesitant to do so, mostly because, due to my wish to wait to have sex, I didn't want to go too far too quick. Near the end of our relationship, she wanted to have penetrative sex. She said that she wanted a commitment.

We were both too young for marriage (she was 20, I was 23), and I think, due to my beliefs, she felt that us having sex would be a good commitment. I was very against this. I was uncomfortable with why she wanted to do it, using sex as a surrogate of sorts for a proposal. I also think it was a way for her to attempt to fix the relationship, which was starting to fail at this point.

I realized after a few failed relationships that marriage was kind of an arbitrary deadline. At the end of the day, I realized that my choice to stay a virgin had nothing to do with my religious beliefs, and far more to do with my self esteem. I feel that if I were to lose my virginity to someone and then the relationship end, it would eat at me. I don't think I would be able to handle the rejection after sharing such an intimate, momentous experience in my life.

As far as virginity goes, you only have one shot. I want it to be with someone with whom that act will build something. I want it to have emotional meaning, not just a chore to be completed in order to be considered an adult. When I lose my virginity, I want it to be with someone who I love, and I want it to be a good, positive experience for the both of us. It really doesn't matter if she is a virgin. It doesn't matter if we are married. It just matters if it is the right time, it is the right person, and that it is part of a lifetime partnership.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How have your partners reacted?</span>
When I tell a partner that I am a virgin, it is generally met with surprise. Because of how I look (I've lost a lot of weight since college), I think people just assume I'm sexually active. My partners have, for the most part, respected the choice, and it has not been an issue.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Any general thoughts on virginity in our society?</span>
I feel often times in our society, virgins are treated as naive, inexperienced, and religious zealots. It is as if we can't truly know what love is, or what sexual pleasure is like. Most of my good friends know about my virginity, and though it is poked fun at, it is in a positive way. But often, a virgin's opinions can be dismissed in conversations about sex because of their perceived inexperience.

I know that there are a lot of virgins that are ashamed of that aspect of themselves, and I think it's due to the label that our society places on us, and the stereotypes that are held. To quote an earlier poster, my virginity does not define me. It is an aspect of my overall self.

But, to a large degree, I feel empowered by my virginity. I have the power to say no to sex. I've heard some people regret losing their virginity, due to the circumstances of one sort or another (too young, wrong person, etc). But I have the ability to decide when, with who, and what the other circumstances are. I can make it exactly what I want it to be, and that is powerful.]]></content:encoded>

Actually, we think it's perfect!</span>

First, because we want to hear about all sorts of experiences in the hopes you see yourselves in one of these stories. And second, given all the conversation we had at <a href="http://rethinkingvirginity.tumblr.com/">Rethinking Virginity</a> on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Slut Shaming </span>and<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Virgin Shaming</span>, we think it's totally timely! So, thanks so much for sharing this, Carla, and take it away...

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tell us about yourself:</span>
My name's Carla, I'm twenty-one, British-American, have lived in France for most of my life and currently live in Taiwan. I'm hoping to go to grad school here in September, but for the moment I have little to no idea as to what will happen over the next few months.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">What is your definition of virginity?</span>
The first thing that comes to mind is always penetrative sex, obviously, but as far as I'm concerned a virgin would bee someone who has never done anything, including oral and the like.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How did you 'lose your virgnity?'</span>
I grew up in a very liberal household, in France, which is a pretty open country about those matters (as long as it's heterosexual, as in many places, the rest is more...complicated). From a pretty young I age I was extremely interested in depictions of sex, and I started masturbating pretty early.

I lost my virginity at the age of fifteen, to a friend, at a party. This obviously makes me a slut to many people. I don't care. I wanted to; I knew him, I trusted him, I really wanted to do it, of course we protected ourselves-I may be a slut but I'm far from stupid, and I remember it as being fun. Not many people I know enjoyed their first time as much as I did, yet I'm the one who's supposed to be regretting it, because I didn't wait for love, or whatnot. Just as well, because I didn't fall in love until I was seventeen, and looking back on it, it was puppy love, and rather hilariously ridiculous.

I have a ridiculously high libido, which does make life complicated at times, because women, as a general rule, aren't supposed to. I've met a few men who felt emasculated by it; those didn't last long.

All this doesn't mean I'm not picky, as people have implied in conversations where the word "easy" has come up. Maybe I am easy, I don't know. Does it matter? I enjoy myself, I don't hurt anyone, my experience is split pretty evenly between casual sex and relationships, and the casual sex didn't leave me a used, empty shell as I've seen in some articles. Preposterous.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Any thoughts about cultural attitudes towards virginity?</span>
<span>I think we all have our own relationship with our sexuality, and I personally do not care whether you'd rather stay a virgin or have sex with five people in the same week. As long as it's safe sex, it's not my place to judge, and it's none of my business. I would just like the same principle be applied to me.</span>

I don't like having to defend my choices; I don't see where they're wrong, bad, immoral, or whatnot. I don't see why virgins should have to defend their choices either; if you don't want to have sex, for any reason whatsoever, please don't. I'm a firm believer in doing what's right for you, and that rarely coincides exactly with what society requires or expects of you.

My experience probably doesn't fit with a lot of your readers, since I'm European first and foremost, but where I'm from it's a lot harder to be an older virgin than to be the school slut. I think shaming anyone over the sexual history/ sexuality is ridiculous, and plain mean.
I am not defined by my sexuality. It is a part of me, nothing more, nothing less. I have no more, no less value as a non-virgin than I did as a virgin.

It's funny, because when I first met one of my closest friends here in Taiwan, an American girl, she was still a virgin at the age of twenty-two, and she was embarrassed about it. She only told me once we'd become close friends, and apparently was still worried that I'd judge her for it. It's sad, really.

She wrote us *right after* having sex for the first time–after being scared for years–and she really enjoyed it. YAY! If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong></span><span style="color: #660000; font-style: italic;">.

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I am a 24 year old female who just recently gained her full womanhood by participating in the beautiful act of sexual relations. Currently, I reside in New Orleans but originally I am from Dallas, TX where I will be moving back in December. My boyfriend lives there and I am extremely excited (for obvious reasons). He is the best.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

The realization that you can connect with someone physically by literally becoming attached to them in a way that makes you squeal with joy. Honestly, I view virginity as a way to make people feel awful about a wonderful way as a way to "protect" them from ruining something amazing. But really this is something everyone should be free to explore without guilt. Your first time most likely won't be your last time. It certainly shouldn't be anyway.

<strong>Tell us your story:</strong>

For years, I was scared out of my mind about SEX. Not just scared but down right phobic. My friends found it to be a joke and would tease me endlessly about my fear. I would literally run screaming from the room when my mom would try to talk to me about SEX. Thankfully, I found this amazing guy who was extremely understanding and patient.

Personally, personal touch and time is very important to me and since SEX had been made into such a big deal in my life by religious beliefs and teachings and such I didn't know what to do. I knew it had to happen sometime, I couldn't get married without it but I was terrified I wouldn't like it or that it wouldn't work then there would be this horridly awful thing to deal with a person you JUST made a huge life commitment to. Plus everyone would know. That freaked me out the most, that everyone would KNOW about the SEX.

Anyway, this amazing man talked with me about it even before we dated. We could talk about anything. He pursued me for five months while I was traveling the southern region of the US. Then we started being committed only to each other. And I realized I actually wanted to have sex with him. I didn't even want to have sex with the guy I was in love with for 8 years *gag* I have never really wanted to have sex with just ANYONE, but I knew I wanted to share it with HIM. He is the one I wanted to share my first time with even if we don't end up together forever. If anyone is "worthy", this one certainly is for various reasons. He was so considerate and sweet, checking up on me in case I was freaking out inside, but I wasn't. I actually didn't freak out at all. This was supposed to happen and I was so happy. His penis was inside my vagina and I didn't start instantly burning (as in hellfire and brimstone, thank God either way). I did not lose anything. I gained my womanhood.

Finally, I do not have to hide behind not knowing or being "innocent" which really means "reason for others to feel superior." I can't wait to move home and be a woman more often. By the way, this just happened on October 11, 2012.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a 24-year-old woman from London.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

When you've not had any kind of sexual contact, be it with another person or yourself.

<strong>Tell us your story:</strong>

I'm Jewish, and a recently-discovered bisexual (preferring women to men mainly). It took me several years to figure that out and I'm only comfortable in considering so now, but still reluctant to talk about it.

I'm still a virgin and as most people don't know, it takes a bit of wriggling out of the conversation so they will forget about the topic. The ones who do know mainly treat me like a freak, especially because I have never had a relationship, been on a date or ever been kissed, especially at my age when most people have had a few years experience. I am patronized easily by them, even if they are my friends, and I find myself being left out of conversations because of it. I'm not waiting for marriage, just for the right person.

I'm finally ready to start but with little choice and not much support, I find it difficult to express myself. I'm adept at solo sex and have been for some time but I understand that society doesn't seem to count that as real sex. Being literally untouched, I will still have to consider myself a virgin compared to most other people.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I am a 29-year-old male that lives in Atlanta, Georgia.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

A virgin is someone who has not experienced a consensual, sexual encounter where one or both persons is partially or fully nude and one or both persons is brought to orgasm.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

I am a shy and socially awkward male with a poor presentation that does not attract females. I am still happy to be a virgin at 29 because I have had more time to educate myself about the risks of sexually transmitted infections. I feel if I had sex when I was young, I would have contracted something. However, I feel virginity is overrated, the important thing is to practice safe sex with a loving partner.]]></content:encoded>

I’m 23 years old.

Depending on who you ask, I’m a single woman or a wife, "sex-crazy" or sex-positive, a slut or a virgin. Obviously, I can’t be all of these things... but just as obviously, the wide variety of people and institutions I interact with throughout my day-to-day life are defining these terms very differently than I do. So let me be more clear, and maybe help you clear up some of your own confusion about what labels you "have to" use, and what labels you want to proudly claim for your own.

About four and a half years ago, my girlfriend Katie and I had what we would have called our "first time." Since we’re both women, we don’t have the ease of understanding or assuming what "losing your virginity" is that someone paired with another person of a different gender might have. After a lot of conversations, we came to the decision that we didn’t want to be completely naked together until we had a room where we had a right to close and lock the door without anyone questioning us- in other words, until I could travel to her dorm room at her college rather than just seeing each other when we were both on break in our hometown. It was sweet, sometimes awkward, incredibly meaningful, and overall a wonderful "first time."

But that’s not the end of the story.

Over the next several years of our relationship, we grew and changed in ways that humans tend to do. We decided that, honestly, anything we did together that caused orgasms really counted as sex, and so while we’ll always love our "first time," we’d been having sex for quite a while before that.

Simultaneously, we faced a world that doesn’t really know what it thinks about lesbians and sex, other than that it’s probably bad. I heard in so many ways how my relationship wasn’t valid. I had a bulletin-board conversation with one of my floormates about how I couldn’t really ever have sex, only "sexual acts," since no penises were entering any vaginas. (This caused an awful lot of running jokes among my friends from that point on- "Are you and Katie going to go have not-sex now? Did you have tons of wild, wild not-sex over your Valentine’s Weekend trip?")

I even had a leader of a fairly nonconformative group on campus tell me to my face that, "Of course I was still a virgin." As headstrong and self-confident as I tried to be, I couldn’t shake a nagging feeling that maybe these people were onto something. Did this really not count?

Nearly three years after that first idea of a first time, I was still dating Katie and we’d exchanged engagement rings. We’d also been talking more and more about polyamory, and had finally taken the first nervous step of indicating our interest to another engaged couple in our social circle who were generally known to be open. That first poly relationship had more rules than I could shake a stick at- and a lot of them had to do with what we were calling sex, and how we felt about what we were doing. Yeah, we were all having sex, but only certain kinds with certain people at certain times- and it got even more complicated when I (confirmed, out-and-proud lesbian harboring confusing bisexual tendencies) was interacting in EXTREMELY AWKWARD ways with the male person in that couple. Emotional and intimate issues eventually led us to separate from them.

So now who was I? I’d slept with two people besides my fiancee... sort of? But everyone consented, so it wasn’t like I was a cheating hussy or anything. But I still liked girls better. Yeah. That’s right.

Then, of course, I had to go and fall in love with another man, and the tangle of that relationship could take a novel all of its own. I was head over heels for only the second time in my life, and I thought I’d found the solution to my fears about sex with men: someone kind and gentle and ostensibly pure; a very Christian, definitely virgin, partner.

Suffice to say, polyamory only works when everyone involved is honest not only with each other, but with themselves, and can clearly state their own needs and issues. He was dealing with a lot of shame and self-loathing about the concept of sex in general, and we spent several months in the surreal state where he insisted that we weren’t having sex if it was just dry humping, and I assured him (not just quietly, but firmly, more than once) that it sure felt like sex to me. In the end, our differences tore us apart in a very messy way - I said unfortunate things in public, Katie cried (an occasion of once a decade or so), and this guy turned up what had previously been an annoying tendency to wheedle into full-out emotional manipulation and abuse. When he left, I told Katie that I was done with men. They just hurt me.

But here we are now. I’m typing this letter to all of you sitting in bed next to Katie (who is now my wife, according to my church and everyone who matters), the smell of our boyfriend still clinging to the pillows, and I can see our girlfriend’s hairbrush where she forgot it on the bookshelf. Turns out that while Katie and I were learning about maturity, heartbreak, and what a really bad relationship looks like, John and Emily, that first couple we were with, were learning their own lessons. Emily doesn’t let her insecurity keep her from enjoying her bisexuality to the fullest. Katie is more willing to trust human beings in general. John is much more conscious about balancing his now-wife’s needs with caring for the other women he loves. And I have finally gotten over my own guilt trip about loving men enough to finally REALLY enjoy sex with him.

Today, I went to Planned Parenthood to get fitted for a diaphragm so I can feel as confident as possible about minimizing pregnancy risks before I do what a lot of people call losing my virginity.

When I filled out my new client paperwork, I cringed as I marked my marital status as single, because according to the government, Katie doesn’t count. When I added my emergency contact information, I proudly listed Katie’s phone number, and noted under relationship the word Wife.

Finally, I went into my appointment to get fitted for birth control. I was incredibly grateful that the clinic staff seemed entirely uninterested in questioning these discrepancies - I really didn’t want any delays.

I’m planning to have intercourse for the first time as soon as we can manage a good stretch of time, because otherwise we might just pounce each other like animals in the middle of cooking each other a nice dinner some night this week. It’s unbelievable how good and healing it feels to finally be having the kind of relationships I want, in the ways that I want, and for the most part on the terms that I want. I can’t change the world, but I think I’ve finally got a handle- at least for the moment- on how I see myself.

I guess what I’m trying to say is, whoever you are, whatever you are or aren’t doing with whatever people of whatever gender in whatever numbers or combinations: it’s okay.

Seriously, it’s okay. You can call yourself a virgin if that word has a lot of meaning for you, but don’t let people use it like a measuring rod or a judgement from on high. You can call yourself a lesbian, bisexual, straight, ace, whatever; but don’t let that stop you from admitting when you love someone, because you might just be missing out on some amazing experiences. You can build whatever relationship structures you like, as long as they’re working for everyone involved. More important than definitions or rules is your own comfort, your own consent, and your own desire.

So go out there and love freely (and safely!), and be who you want to be. And only you get to decide whether or not you’re a "virgin."

Yeah, we know the feeling. Thanks for contributing to the blog, D!</span>

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #660000;">If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong>. We'd love to run it in this blog!
</span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tell us about yourself:</span>

I am 25 years old, female, heterosexual, and a virgin. I consider myself to be a very religious Jew, but if you have any kind of image in your head of what a religious Jew looks like, I won’t fit any aspect of it.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How do you define virginity?</span>

Any below the waist penetration (I realize that is a rather hetero-normative definition, but that's how I define it for myself). I’ve actually had oral sex, and personally didn’t feel like I was doing anything more significant than adding an extra-fun part to making out.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why did you decide to stay a virgin?</span>

I often ask myself the same question. It’s probably a combination of growing up in a traditional society, combined with the fact that I’m a late bloomer.

While my religious upbringing was relatively liberal when it comes to observant Judaism, premarital sex has always been taboo; my parents, who are relatively liberal in many other respects, will still occasionally say things like having premarital sex is morally wrong, or will doom your relationship to failure—after all, why would a guy consider marrying you if you’re having sex with him anyway? I don’t agree with them, but that attitude still has an effect.

The result is that on the one hand, I’m a huge feminist and a staunch believer that women should be free to express themselves sexually, but on the other I have this fear that if I have premarital sex I’ll "lose value." There’s also so much silence surrounding sexuality in my religious community. I know so many traditional but modern Jews who are having sex, but no one will talk about it, and everyone pretends it isn’t happening. So there’s a lot of confusion and stigma.

Growing up I had crushes on literary characters and movie stars, but it never occurred to me that the men in real life could be sexually interesting until the middle of college. I had my first kiss when I was almost 22. Sexuality is a new and somewhat scary area for me, and I need to know that the person I finally do have sex with will be waking up with me many mornings afterwards.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How have your partners reacted?</span>

I haven’t been with anyone long enough that it’s been necessary to break the news. But it does make getting into things a little more fraught; I tend to imply that I’m more sexually experienced than I am, so I get nervous if a flirtation escalates, and I think there’s going to be some physical activity at some future point. I start to feel like I’ve led the guy on, and that I can’t make the first move, because if I make a move he’s going to expect to have sex with me, and expects that I’ve already had sex. I’m also afraid that when the subject does come up in the context of a serious relationship, the guy will be freaked out.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Any general thoughts on virginity in our society?</span>

As I grew up, the attitude was "Oh my God, you want to have sex? What’s wrong with you?" Then, at a certain point, it became "Oh my God, you’re not having sex? What’s wrong with you?"

Having choices and sexual freedom includes the ability to say no, and to make your own decision about when you’re ready to do what. I just wish more people understood that.]]></content:encoded>

We'd love to run it in this blog!</span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tell us about yourself:</span>

I'm an almost 26-year-old, straight, white woman from Texas who is still a virgin. I think the main reason for this is because I've never had a serious, long-term relationship in my adult life. I've gone on dates, I've "messed around," had drunken makeouts, but nothing has led to a relationship where I feel comfortable going further sexually. The guys I meet are really only interested in sex and if I don't give that to them within the first few dates or within a month, I'm tossed to the side without so much as a phone call or even a text.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How do you define virginity?</span>

I had defined it as vaginal intercourse for a long time, but have recently revised that. I had my first real sexual experience with another person when I was 19, so if it's a matter of a hymen breaking, that was years ago. If it's oral sex, then I was 21. I mean, I've literally been completely naked with another guy, practically going through the motions without insertion and yet by traditional definition, I'm still a virgin.

I feel like not having vaginal intercourse is really a mere technicality, although my close girl friends tend to disagree and still think that I'm a virgin. As much as I love my friends, it's annoying and it kinda hurts when they think everything I've done isn't enough to declassify me as a virgin and that I just need to "get laid already."

I enjoy intimacy immensely, even if it's just a drunk make-out with a friend. As of right now, it's been six months since my last go-round and I think this is the longest dry spell I've had in a couple of years. It's also frustrating being the only single girl when almost all of my friends are either married, engaged or just in a long-term relationship.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How have your partners reacted?</span>

Mentioning that to the guys I've been intimate with has been a deterrent, although not one has ever said anything derogatory about it. It's almost like they put me on a higher plane because of being my being a virgin in my mid-twenties, and they didn't want to be the "first one" to mess it up for me.

One guy I dated wanted so badly to have sex with me, but once I mentioned the virginity thing, he thought it over, said he absolutely respected my choice. He dumped me 2 1/2 weeks later, saying that we were just "no mas."

I want it to be with someone that I trust, and hopefully, a relationship that will actually go somewhere (not marriage! not ready for that) instead of abruptly ending after a month because I didn't put out fast enough. Maybe it's the guys I meet, they still think it's college and they should "hook up with as many girls as possible" and the only relationships worth having are those without strings attached.

I'm TIRED of being the single friend and the third wheel. It always amazes me the girls who jump from one relationship to another like it's nothing. I'm super laid back, smart, educated, I don't have any weird emotional baggage. It's confusing because I KNOW guys find me attractive, yet I don't understand what's wrong with me in that I don't know how to make them stay around. Then again, the guys I've been with weren't worth keeping, in retrospect. But is it just me? Had I not been a "virgin," would things have panned out differently?]]></content:encoded>

At the time she said:
</span><span style="color: #660000;">
</span>
<blockquote>"Since I've figured out that I'm bi, I would love to have sex with someone I actually like, no matter the gender. But I'm still a virgin because I'm really shy, really scared, and I have a hard time getting close to people physically, not even on a sexual level.</blockquote>
It's weird, but you get to the point to where you lie about sex for your friends or smile and nod at their stories, like you know where they're coming from (no pun intended) when you have no idea what's its like. It's expected that you've had sex, and if you haven't, you must be really religious...or have vagina dentata."

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #660000;">She just sent us this follow-up to her story, almost a year later. This may not be a road everyone goes down, but it goes to show again that <span style="font-weight: bold;">there is no one </span></span><span style="color: #660000; font-weight: bold;">right</span><span style="font-style: italic; color: #660000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> way to 'lose your virginity.'</span></span>

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #660000;">If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong>. We'd love to run it in this blog!
</span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tell us about yourself:</span>
I am a bisexual 26-year-old female librarian in one of those really big rectangular states in the middle to western part of the United States. I grew up in a less rectangular state, and was pretty standard Christian conservative until I was about 15, with a brief moment of religiosity when I was 22. I'm currently an agnostic, leaning towards atheism, pending further research.

My parents do not discuss sex. I was home-schooled when most kids were taking sex ed in my district, so I read a book about how sex worked, shortly followed by a book on how I should "court" guys with the approval of my father. Luckily for my sister and me, our dad never really enforced courtship.

Being bi, sexual attraction was super complicated, especially in a religious household. I sort of kept all of my attractions under wraps until I hit college which means I didn't mention it or try to think about it. I hit the end of my freshman year by going to England as part of a class and making out with multiple nameless guys. And then there was the years long dry spell of no make outs, no boyfriends, no girlfriends, while I worked on school, and then grad school. That sort of brings us to today.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">What is your definition of virginity?</span>
Because of my orientation, I think defining sex is the first step. I know a lot of folk are more strict about the definition of sex. For me the definition of sex is two or more people who are making an effort to get each other to orgasm in a consensual situation, and generally nudity is involved. It's maddeningly vague.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why did you decide to stay a virgin?</span>
I signed a virginity pledge (hilariously misspelled) when I was about 13 as a precaution should I start feeling immoral thoughts about boys, because liking girls was just "weird" and not possible. All my friends sort of kept up with the whole, "I will remain a virgin" until marriage at least in theory. When I went to college, I met a group of awesome sex-positive women of all orientations, who, incidentally, all lived on my floor. While I am not in contact with many of them anymore, they were integral in my acknowledgment that I was more than a little bit gay when I was 21.

As to why I decided to stay a virgin: In short, I'm really goal oriented. In my head I had a list of priorities in my life. The priority list was as follows:
1. School. (High school, getting into college, College, Getting into grad school, Grad school)
2. Work
3. Friends
4. ???
5. Sex
So, I went through life checking off my priorities, and sex was just something that kept being put off because I was busy doing other things.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How did you 'lose your virginity?'</span>
"Lost" really isn't the right word. I chucked it with great force at the first actual opportunity I had at the ripe old age of 26. Granted, I don't recommend my methods to everyone, because the part of me that likes to be safe will point out that this was a bit of a risk. Flying to a completely different state to meet up with someone you'd never actually met is risky, no matter what. That being said, I had fun, it turned out well, and no one was an axe murderer (always a bonus).

I'm very shy and have a bit of social anxiety, so I tend to communicate with my friends on the internet and have made a few friends that way. One of these internet friends (Let's call him A) who I'd been talking to for quite awhile invited me to visit him and a polyamorous partner of his (female, and I'll call her B) in another state. After much hemming and hawing, I agreed, although to this day I'm not entirely sure why or how I decided to go.

Prior to even making the official trip plans, I had divulged my virginal status to A. I'm not really sure why, considering how much shame I felt about it at the time, but it saved me a very awkward in person conversation, which I'd have probably stuttered through or not had.

I ended up on a plane to this other state for a long weekend where I met A and B at the airport. We hung out that evening, went to museum, had dinner, and went to bed together, where nudity ensued, with yes, two people I had met that day. And thus I lost my gay virginity. It took a couple of days before I had actual penis-in-vagina sex, between false starts and me having a minor panic attack (thanks social anxiety and related to meeting lots of new people all at once) my first full day. I'll be honest, there was awkwardness on my part and occasional pain, but both were pretty temporary.

Overall, the weekend was very fun and I can't think of a better way to do it. My partners in deflowerment really couldn't have been nicer.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Any thoughts about cultural attitudes towards virginity?</span>
I feel a certain degree of envy for those who actively choose to remain virgins because in some ways, it's more empowering. There's a choice in the matter. After a while, I felt like I didn't have a choice. It was either be a cat lady or give up swearing, become a Catholic, and join a nunnery. For me, the issue became more and more about how I felt I was unattractive and that while I was willing to have sex, for whatever reason, I was not good enough, which isn't conducive to getting anyone close to your pants.

It's rough. We're all supposed to wait for that one special person to lose it to. Even if we don't stay with that individual, you're supposed to hold out for someone "special." But if you wait too long, you feel shameful about how long it's taken, because there must be something wrong with you. There's no way to win.]]></content:encoded>

We met SM through <a href="http://www.asexuality.org/home/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">AVEN</span></a>, the Asexual Visibility and Education Network. Their website has information, forums and links for and about people who don't experience sexual attraction. </span><span style="font-style: italic; color: #660000;">If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong>.

I'm a 19-year-old male virgin who identifies as asexual. An asexual is someone who doesn’t experience sexual attraction to anyone. It’s helpful to think of it as a sexual orientation, the natural other category with hetero-, homo- and bi-sexual.

I was asked to do a First Person post what now seems like a very long time ago. I thought that inspiration would come easily, that I had a lot to say on the topic. I’ve failed many times in writing this, and I now realise that I’ve got nothing.

Some asexuals deny the existence of an asexual virgin. The idea is that a virgin is someone waiting to have sex, defined by the fact that they haven’t had sex YET. And asexuals aren’t people who haven’t had sex yet-they’re people who aren’t going to have sex at all.

I’m not too sure about this definition myself; personally, I think I’m fully capable of having and enjoying sex, and vaguely plan to get round to it sometime in the future. Maybe. But the asexual community tends to give people like me space to decide that the virgin label really doesn’t matter.

So I sat down to write a detailed description of how the idea of virginity impacts me, and I realised it doesn’t, really. Sure, I can talk about the virginity paradigm in an abstracted sociological sense, but this blog already does that. Getting into my personal feelings on virginity was difficult. Ironically, given that I’ve already been through this when discovering my sexuality, I was failing to notice an absence of feelings.

I tend to disrupt virgin stereotypes; I happily play the ‘dirty-minded asexual’, comfortable with innuendos and sexuality. At this stage in my life, it’s not too surprising that I’m a virgin, as I grow older (if I remain a virgin), I think people won’t notice. So maybe the asexual exemption clause applies to me, too, I’m not stuck at a stage in the system- I’m outside the system. Not because I will never have sex, but because I don’t believe that my sexual history is a reflection of where I am as a sexual being.

Asexuality is quite introspective, and for me particularly, my sexuality is based more on what goes on inside my head than in my (non-existent) love life. I think I've escaped the need to validate my sexuality with what I do or don't do, it's just about what I feel or don't feel. I don’t believe (although I can’t be certain) that I will change after having sex, that I will feel fundamentally on new ground.]]></content:encoded>

We'd love to run it in this blog!</span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How do you define virginity?</span>
First, can I say how much I abhor that word? Its so loaded with stifling negative assumptions. I don't really label myself a virgin in the traditional sense. I mean, yes, the final step in "losing it" for me, a 25-year-old black straight-ish cis woman, is vaginal penetration with a penis. But the key word there is "step." To me, throwing off your virginity isn't like smashing a window, but ascending a flight of stairs. Its a series of experiences that lead to that personal point where one feels they've completed sexual debut. And my experiences to date just don't confine me to the traditional virgin/non-virgin binary.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How did you lose your virginity, or why have you kept it?</span>
I'm losing my virginity in slow motion. That's really the best way to describe it. I spent my high school years in the Southern Baptist church (my form of teenage rebellion), which gave me rather twisted and unhealthy notions of sex, love and relationships. At 18, I called myself conservative, signed a purity pledge and even thought I'd save my first kiss for the altar, because that's what "good girls" did.

Later, in college, I realized how duped I'd been by the church, and things began to change. Here's the rundown:

My first kiss was at 19. I was 22 for my first make out session. 23 the first time I was fingered, and got completely naked in front of someone. 24 when I gave my first blow job, got lip service, did insertion and had what I now recognize was a "just the tip" experience (thank you, NOLA).

And at 25, the first (and only) time I had a partnered orgasm. So far, that's 5 "virginities." No P-in-V yet, but each of those experiences are very important to me and really feel like virginities in and of themselves.

For a long time, I wasn't ready to go that step. I was still a slave to that Baptist idea that sex irrevocably damages you. It was only recently, after reading "Yes Means Yes" and "The Purity Myth" that I've finally broken the chains. And that partnered orgasm? It was with a very dear friend and where I finally decided I was ready take that last step (well, that's putting it mildly. I was damn near begging for it). Although we didn't (he was hesitant to hurt our relationship), it was still a profound realization. At last, there's nothing holding me back. And that's when I decided to create my own rules.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Which are?</span>
Rule #1: NEVER fake it. It neither gives you pleasure, nor helps your partner in the long run.
Rule #2: Never measure a person's worth by their sexual experience.]]></content:encoded>

Back then, she told us that so far nothing has "led to a relationship where I feel comfortable going further sexually." However she also felt that "not having vaginal intercourse is really a mere technicality, although my close girl friends tend to disagree and still think that I'm a virgin."</span>

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #660000;">But soon after we posted her story, she emailed us again with a kind of surprising update. She met a guy online who ended up coming to her town for work. They met up one evening and here's what happened:</span>

I had planned on meeting him somewhere public, but eventually went to the hotel where he was staying, even though I wasn't exactly comfortable with the idea <span style="font-weight: bold;">[please see our note at the bottom of this post]</span>. So I get to his room, and he is just ridiculously hot. We sat on the bed and started talking. It turned out that we are both of [the same ethnic] heritage, which made him even more attractive to me and vice versa.

We were making out within 15 minutes and the clothes were mostly off within 30 minutes. We ended up not doing full penetration only because he was kind of big and it hurt like hell when he tried. I never said anything about my previous experience, but he did ask how many guys I'd been with. I panicked a little and said only one, which he found surprising. Pretty much everything we did was stuff I had done before. I really wanted to stay the night, but the thought of doing a walk of shame in front of my parents the next morning didn't seem like a great idea.

I really don't feel like I "lost" anything or that I'm suddenly a different person. I guess technically I'm not a virgin anymore, but I feel more like I just went a little bit further with him than I had done with previous partners.

He was definitely the first guy to bring me to orgasm, so that part was different. I really think had he not been a) so attractive and b) so sexually aggressive (in a good way), it probably would've just been another makeout. I'm more shocked at myself in that I was so intimate with someone I literally know like five things about.

We talked a little the next day. He asked if that's something I do a lot, and I told him no, what I had done was so out of character for me. I teased him about probably having a girl like me in every city he's laid over in, and he said no. I'm not completely sure if I believe him, but anyway, I don't regret it at all. I talked it over with my best friend, and she congratulated me and thought it was best for me to do it with someone like that so that my heart isn't broken if it was someone I was in a relationship with. I kind of agree and kind of don't.

I'm just surprised I was able to sleep with a guy that was so incredibly good looking and thought the same about me. He knew what he was doing, and listened when I said I didn't like something he was doing or was uncomfortable. It was just fun and crazy.

<strong><span style="font-style: italic; color: #990000;">And now an update on the update:</span></strong>

I still haven't heard from the hottie in the story since that weekend, but I've met a really nice guy since then and we've been dating the last few weeks.

It's nice not feeling like I have the "virgin" burden weighing on me, but he did say after we were intimate the first time "You haven't had a lot of sex, have you?" I said yes, but that I wasn't a virgin and didn't go into much detail after that. He seemed satisfied with that answer. It's so interesting the way things work out.

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #990000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Editor's note: </span>We're really happy things worked out for Jan, but the big sister in us has to say that meeting strangers in private places like hotel rooms can be <span style="font-weight: bold;">an extremely risky thing to do</span>. You should always meet someone you don't know in a public place and then see how you feel about them. It doesn't matter what they want to do - this is all about your safety. <a href="http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2010/07/27/safecall-in-practice/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Read this very useful post from the Yes Means Yes blog about </span></a><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2010/07/27/safecall-in-practice/">SafeCalls.</a></span>

I am a 22-year male virgin. Not only am I a virgin, but I have never been kissed or asked a girl on a date. Not that there haven't been girls that I've liked, quite the opposite; but even thinking about telling a girl about how I feel sends me into a full-blown panic attack. I often feel that drugs and booze are the only way that I can express myself, but those sometimes turn against me; I simply don't know what to think.

It might worth adding a few things: I didn't come from a religious or repressive household; on the contrary, I have always been able to discuss sex and relationship issues openly with my family. I'm not a hopeless romantic either, and although I certainly would like to find a special someone, I'm not naively hung-up on saving it as something major; at this point, I'd rather just get it over with so if and when I do find someone I'm not completely awkward and inept.

Lastly, I have no problems talking to girls on a friendly level, and I cherish having female friends who lend balance to the testosterone circus (and though they are female, they will always be my 'dudes'). It's only when I find myself developing more-than-friend feelings that I panic; I'm currently looking into therapy for that.

I discovered [this blog] couple of months ago, and it has since been a source of comfort for me. It's helpful to know that I'm not alone, or a bumbling freak of nature like I'd be thought of by many. Most of my college classes are populated by males who feel that burning male need to talk endlessly of their 'conquests'; as you might imagine, being surrounded by that in my position can be rather embarrassing, not to mention annoying.

Do you have any advice for me?]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I&#39;m in much the same boat, Mark, but seven years further down the road. You&#39;re right to seek therapy as that can help unpack your anxieties and determine their root cause. Your finances might be tight if you&#39;re in or just out of college, but it&#39;s worth the cost. If your school offers mental health services, definitely take it up on that.<br /><br />You mentioned you have no problem speaking to women on a friendly level. Do you have any female friends -- preferably ones for whom you do not have romantic feelings -- you trust enough to talk to about this? Or maybe your parents? I just get the feeling this isn&#39;t something you speak of frequently. Just having an outlet or a sympathetic ear can help take the edge off the feeling that you&#39;re all alone.<br /><br />Lastly, pay no heed to that sea of testosterone in your classes. If college-age males got laid half as often as they claim, they&#39;d never have time to study.<br /><br />Good luck, brother.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I feel that therapy will be helpful for you. A therapist can help teach you new ways to think out the feelings you are experiencing and redirect them into new ways of thinking. So, instead of going OH GOD WHAT DO I DO SHE&#39;LL HATE ME IF I DON&#39;T DO THIS PERFECT can instead turn into concentrating on your conversation. It&#39;s possible! I swear!<br /><br />I have a guy friend that got super duper awkward around girls he was possibly interested in, and he hated himself for it. I used to coach him on how to chill out on AIM and he&#39;d be okay for a little then fall back into familiar patterns.  He&#39;s still like that and will occasionally throw out how much he hates it into conversation. He&#39;s completely self-loathing. Don&#39;t be that guy!<br /><br />I don&#39;t want to give you any advice on the awkwardness straight-up. I&#39;ll leave that to a professional.<br /><br />There are actually males your age who are not obsessed with being laid. It&#39;s certainly a thought, but they can talk about other things, too. Perhaps finding avenues to find new types of people can socially help? Maybe a club or a sport? I&#39;m including badminton as a sport. Just SOMETHING to be around different types of people who don&#39;t have thug mentalities about conquests. Sometimes being around a new crowd can help. If one doesn&#39;t work, try another. If your school is pretty small, try the nearby town for new people.  The only thing you have to lose by exploring is... well, you have nothing to lose! So much to gain.<br /><br />To solve your never been kissed thing, I suggest enlisting a friend to smooch just to know what it feels like to have someone else&#39;s face up in your business. That may help take away a part of the fear... make sure they know it&#39;s for scientific purposes ahead of time.<br /><br />Good luck, dude! you&#39;ll be great. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Be patient, be brave.  <br /><br />I wonder if you have any sense of why romantic/sexual context sends you into a panic spiral - are you anxious about lack of experience? insecure about your body/performance/self? scared of rejection?  Identifying what you&#39;re afraid of can help moderate the fear from amorphous panic to a more reasonable, manageable nervousness.  <br /><br />I also think that for many people, dating becomes easier after college.  You meet more strangers, maybe live in a bigger city.  Go on internet dates.  They might not mean anything, but you&#39;ll feel less nervous after you get a few under your belt.<br /><br />And, in case this helps with the anxiety - I don&#39;t think that you need to tell the first girl you kiss or ask out on a date that she&#39;s the first for that.  She might not think you&#39;re an awesome kisser, but the same happens for plenty of experienced guys.  <br /><br />Figure out what you&#39;re scared of.  This will help.]]></wp:comment_content>

Thanks to <a href="http://www.hanneblank.com/">Hanne Blank</a> for letting us know about it, and a very special thanks to its author <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://happybodies.wordpress.com/author/schwarta/">Allie</a> for letting us cross-post it here! <span style="color: #660000; font-style: italic;">If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong>. We'd love to run it in this blog!</span></span>

<span style="color: black;">Having sex had nothing to do with it, because to this day I have not engaged in any kind of partner sex. My Catholic upbringing regularly impressed notions of chastity, purity, sexual repression, and guilt guilt guilt. I have been socialized with the idea that if you get to 22 and you haven’t had sex yet, there’s something wrong. I was sure being overweight had something to do with it. I was sure my personality had something to do with it. As I got older, I was sure my lack of experience had something to do with it. There’s got to be something wrong with me, or my body, or my way of life.</span>

But here’s the thing: there isn’t.

The revelation of my not-virginity came to me in pieces. The first was while I was skyping with Becky. We were talking about me being a virgin, despite the fact that I know more about sex than a lot of people. Despite the fact that I am better than most people at talking about sex. Despite the fact that I am extremely familiar with my body, my desires, my needs. The second half of this revelation was a day later while re-reading <a href="http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/about-yes-means-yes/">Yes means Yes!</a>, particularly in an essay by Hanne Blank about "process-oriented virgins". I have subscribed to a transitional approach to virginity for a while, but in my brain claiming "not virgin" still required experience with some kind of partnered sex. Why is "virgin" a label people people can claim despite conventional evidence to the contrary? Why isn’t "not-virgin"? And of course, it is.

I still carry with me a lot of the implications virginity has on my life. Sometimes I am sort of terrified by the idea of flirting because it might lead to some kind of relationship (friendship or romantic) and I would feel weirdly obligated to reveal my virginity and they would scoff and leave me alone. Now I can start regularly thinking "I am not a virgin", acclimating to the idea, and letting those words sink into my daily actions.

I am not here to stabilize notions of virginity or female sexuality. I am here to claim my body as my own and claim my experience as valid. I have never engaged in partner sex, and I might never choose to do so. I have decided, here and now, not to be burdened by the label of virgin.

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">And a note from Allie: </span>This is one of my submissions to the ongoing series "When did you know?", an examination of the intersection of labels and identity. Information on how to submit your piece to the series can be found on the </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://happybodies.wordpress.com/join-us/#whendidyouknow">Join Us</a><span style="font-style: italic;"> page.

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>
I am 25 years old and studying creative writing in New York City.  I grew up in Texas, and until a few months ago, I was a virgin.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>
I know the definition I grew up with: that a virgin is someone who has not had penis-in-vagina sex. Now, I find that definition unsatisfactory for lots of reasons. It is not just that this definition applies only to heterosexuals, but I'm not sure that it works for heterosexuals either. When we talk about virginity loss we are not simply talking about a physical change, but something far more complex, an intangible, filled with deeply symbolic meanings. The categories of "virgin" and "non-virgin" fail to take into account the richness of sexual experience. It invests so much in one single moment (the moment in which a penis first enters a vagina) as this moment of profound change in our lives–when we pass magically from girls into women.
We are taught that this moment will somehow determine the rest of our sexual lives and it's a decision we take cautiously, because (as women especially) we are told that when and how we lose our virginity has a lot to say about the people we are.

<strong>Why did you wait and why did you stop waiting?</strong>
As a girl, I grew up hearing that for women sex is profoundly emotional. We must be careful, we must protect ourselves, and we must be very, very certain that the decisions we make about sex are the right ones. Why? Because the emotions that accompany sex for women might be too difficult or overwhelming if not shared with the right person at the right time.
When I did finally have sex it was with a guy, a friend of a friend, who I knew for about twelve hours.  They were a significant twelve hours in my life, and they were not devoid of emotion; in fact, they were full of emotion–excitement, aliveness, and loneliness too–but I did not fall in love as I knew I would not, nor did I fall apart (as had for years been subconsciously told I could).
Recently, after hearing I had had sex, the a male friend said of the guy: "I am not sure this guy was deserving of that." An older friend said to me, "Well, you are still emotionally a virgin." My younger sister, outraged at my one-night-stand said: "Sarah, if a guy is worth it, he shouldn't care about your past."
These comments, though meant well, have a somewhat disturbing message underpinning them: that my sexuality is somehow not my own.  That I threw away my virginity too easily.  That somehow the sex I had was meaningless because it was not shared with a partner.  That I had sex for my future partners or just to get it over with.  When in fact, I had sex because I wanted to.
I found a deeper truth I had known for a long time but was finally giving power to: Each sexual encounter is an expression of my sexuality, but my sexuality has to do with so much more than who I have sex with, or how much sex I have, or if I have ever had sex before. It has to do with my own relationship to my body.  My sexuality is deeply rooted in me.
I can trust in my own desires, my own emotions and move with them. Experiences don't have to fall on the categories of "right" or "wrong" or "mistake".  They are simply expressions of myself–among  many I will make over the course of my life–some of which will feel more authentic than others but all of which matter and are important and true.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Any thoughts on virginity in our society?  </span>
Perhaps the most lasting message girls get is that sex is powerful, scary, and has the potential to hurt you if you are not ready for it.  I think back to my brother and the messages he he received. Decide when you are ready and be safe. Boys hear, in essence, that they are able to make their own choices; that they should trust in their own intelligence and are aware enough of their desires to make responsible decisions about sex.  What a girl hears is very different: That her emotions and desires are not to be trusted but that she should be protected from them.  That she is fragile and could make a bad decision that will leave her harmed.
It perpetuates this notion that our sexuality is defined by external factors. I think of sexuality differently; as something internal whose movement outward takes many forms of expression and sex itself is only one of those.  In this I find great freedom and confidence and joy.]]></content:encoded>

I am almost 30 and never thought I would be a virgin male at this age. I did not date in high school partly because I was too mature. In my junior year I could grow a full beard and was interested in religion, social and science television programs, and books. Little did I know that dating becomes more complex as one ages, and in that way I was very immature. In college I dumped my religious baggage at the dorm door. I still believed in morals–being truthful, kind and good to others–but not in the abstinence part. However, my focus in college was completing my degree and not getting into too much debt. Then after graduation, my focus was on finding a house.

At 27 I was happy. I had a house and liked where I lived, so I started to earnestly look at dating and losing my virginity. I thought dating should be easy. Dating was not easy. I had not dated before so everyone I dated was more experienced than I. Also, I was comfortable being alone, I had a house, friends, a job I enjoyed, freedom, porn, and so I did not need anyone.

After dating a while, I started to get a fear of rejection–not being rejected initially, but being rejected after spending time and effort, then having the relationship end before getting laid. The rejections made me ponder what my excuse for being a virgin is. I am bald but I went with it and shaved my head. I drink and party occasionally. I am 6 feet tall, 190 lbs, not gay, religious, overly shy, or a social introvert.

So basically I am normal and I have no good excuse except it has not happened yet. The longer I stay a virgin, the more it becomes a self-perpetuating feedback loop and the harder it becomes to break free. I still try–I just know now it is more difficult than I expected.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Bob and all the other Anonymouses (?) -- I am totally with you! I spent my formative years being super ambitious, academic and feeling I was mature enough to know I wasn&#39;t mature enough for sex. But once I was ready... crickets in the dating sphere (and then some very awkward dates, then more crickets). The feedback loop, as you call it, is tricky, especially when the average individual in your peer group doesn&#39;t see sex as a big deal, and doesn&#39;t understand why you may not be so comfortable with it. I think especially as a woman, you&#39;re considered a freak or a prude or something worse if you&#39;re over a certain age and still a virgin. I&#39;m embarrassed, even though I know there&#39;s nothing wrong with me, and it&#39;s SO ANNOYING. <br /><br />Thanks for speaking out, Bob!]]></wp:comment_content>

Now that I am ready to become romantically involved with someone, I find I am way behind the curve which just adds to my discomfort.  So many of my friends want me to dive into the numbers game and just date a whole lot, but with my lack of experience, I have found I am more comfortable nurturing one potential relationship at a time. It might take longer that way (also maybe more emotionally taxing?), but I know that&#39;s what I need to feel comfortable until I have caught up more with my peers. I find myself increasingly drawn to the idea of finding a friend I already trust for my first time with sex. Then I can at least cross that off my list of things I haven&#39;t done yet.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I am a 37 year old woman and am angry that I still have mine.   I subscribed to a save-myself-for-marriage mentality and was influenced by religion throughout high school, college, and my early twenties.  Once I realized a wedding wasn&#39;t on the horizon and I started to see cracks in other peoples religious arguments (they were telling me to save my self, but were and had been getting it on) I decided to challenge my beliefs.  However, at my age, I don&#39;t feel like I can throw it away on someone insignificant.   I am frustrated that suitable dates are scarce and that men don&#39;t really care about a woman&#39;s mileage (or lack thereof).   This frustration makes it much harder for me to date when I actually meet someone.   It is a self fulfilling prophecy that has me praying that I don&#39;t die a virgin.]]></wp:comment_content>

Indian guys are not in particularly high demand in the dating sphere, even by Indian women.  I found being the good guy who did not push too hard for sex simply results in no sex.

Also - money.  I don't have much.  A an average white or black guy without money may be able to have sex, but given the already mentioned lack of physical appeal, not having money lowers my appeal to women further.  The women I do sometimes attract just rely on me as an emotional crutch during a tough period in their lives.  Once their lives start to improve, they feel they can get a better man and stop returning my calls.]]></wp:comment_content>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I consider myself a painfully shy 27 year old female from Boston. I was brought up in a generally rigid Pentecostal environment with opinions on sex that pretty much matched up with my church. The turning point was when myself and the other unfortunate youths at my church were roped into what I can only describe as an "ambush purity pledge." Hopping mad, I left the church at 19 and never looked back.

<strong>What is your definition of virginity?</strong>

A garbled one. The old me would have said "willie in hoo ha", but the world is so big, full of so many different people living different lives and looking for different things out of their relationships and encounters with others that all these idiosyncrasies have me overwhelmed. So for now I will just say "untouched", which is what I consider myself to be.

<strong>Why have you chosen to remain a virgin?</strong>

I can only speculate that I don’t want a sexual relationship with another person badly enough to pursue it. I mean if I was really eager I would have done it in my teens or at a "normal age" (as my peers often put it), when hormones were supposedly bouncing off their proverbial walls and horny teen-aged boys were hurling themselves at my feet. I dated a handful of people in college (albeit out of curiosity/intrigue), but the relationships never progressed to a level where I would feel comfortable enough to take that step. I actually didn’t become interested in sex until I was in my 20s and began experimenting with masturbation. I can’t express how great it felt to have learned about my body's' needs on my own, and expelling the "christian guilt" attached to that. I thought "wow, I really don’t need another person for this, do I?"

Now that I am not in an environment where I’m meeting people organically, fostering the kinds of relationships I would consider ideal for pursuing intercourse has become more difficult. And to be perfectly frank, I’m not really trying, which brings me back to my original sentiment: I don’t believe I want a sexual relationship with a partner at this point in my life. If there was a person I was interested in romantically the circumstances would probably be different, but even then I would invest more time in nurturing the human connection, which I value very much, than getting laid.

If I was forced to choose between having sex for the first time or going skydiving (something I have wanted to do since I was 12) I would pick skydiving every time. To me, that’s an exhilarating experience I would remember for the rest of my life. On that scale, sex is something I have no qualms with skipping. Would I like to experience it with a partner someday? Of course, but skydiving first :)]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I am a 21 year old woman, living in the UK, and am currently working as an intern for an online newspaper. I lost my virginity at a camp when I was 18 years old, and am pretty sure was the last one to lose it in my year at school.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

I define virginity as a moment in your life that is overrated and not of much importance when looking at the bigger picture. Virginity is a big deal when you haven't lost it and when you have you look back wondering why you were so worried or scared, as it was over in a millisecond of the whole entire time you spent thinking about it since you got your first bra at the age of 13.

A lot of the girls in my year at school had boyfriends from the age of 15/16 years old, and were open about their sexual experiences. Having not had a proper boyfriend and my 18th birthday was nearing, I did start to look at myself and worry that it was me that was the problem. That maybe I wasn't attractive to the opposite sex, maybe I should dress like the girls who had lost their virginities, and maybe I do not need a boyfriend to fulfil this act. It's different for everyone, but personally, I do not think it was a big deal as my friends and society had told me.

<strong>Why did you wait and why did you stop waiting?</strong>

My virginity was like a box at the back of my mind, and crept closer into my thoughts as the thought of going to University a virgin loomed. It was a big red tick on my ever growing check list in life which included lose weight and marry before 28. I figured the 'get boyfriend' note was not of huge importance as I had already done the first big milestone without having one.

My first time was unpleasant and I felt more relieved than anything else just to have got it out of the way. Did I love him? No. Did I like him? Yes. Well, I fancied him. He seemed to like me and that was that.

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?</strong>

When I was growing, I was told that it was special and that you should wait until you love someone and make sure that they respect you. I like this idea and a part of me wishes I had done this, but I do think this is more of an ideal situation, almost like what you see in films, then what happens in reality. Today girls are losing their virginity to anyone and at younger ages, I think if you love someone and feel ready, do it, if you like someone and they like you, and it feels right at that moment in time, do not let society, peer pressure or any other factors effect your decision.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>First Person: AFG &quot;The virgin/not-virgin dichotomy ignores the importance of self-love&quot;</title>

If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong> We'd love to run it in this blog!</span>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>
I'm a 24-year-old grad student working on a Master's degree. I grew up in a happy, loving, supportive family in Southern Louisiana. I've never been involved in a romantic relationship. I've been told that it's because I don't "put myself out there." Part of that is a fear of rejection. Another part is that I'm the kind of person who takes a while to warm up to new people, and that gets interpreted as being shy and reserved.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>
When I was young, I asked my mom what the word "virgin" meant and she responded with "Where'd you hear that?" as if it was a bad word. When I explained that I'd heard it in church, she relaxed and said, "it's someone who's never loved anyone before." This was my confusing standard working definition until age 9, when my parents gave me and my sister a frank but extemporaneous sex talk and they defined losing your virginity as p-in-v. Currently, in my more nuanced worldview, I think virginity is when you have yet to have a sexual experience that involves the participation of another person. So, you're a virgin until you share your sexuality with someone else.

<strong>Do you consider yourself a virgin? </strong>
I consider myself a virgin because I have yet to kiss someone or let someone touch me or have a sexual, physical exchange with anyone. It's not just that I haven't had penetrative sex, it's also the fact that I have never engaged in any physical demonstration of sexual desire for another person. To go back to my mom's original definition, I'm a virgin because I've never loved anyone before.

<strong>Any thoughts on virginity in our society?</strong>
I think the concept of virginity in our society is really confused. I think some people value it too much, others don't give it the importance that it probably does deserve. The thing that irks me about how people perceive virgins (especially the older ones). It's assumed that virgin means non-sexual and it's not true. I've had many sexual experiences on my own, getting to know my own body with masturbation. This virgin/not-virgin dichotomy ignores the importance of self-love and self-satisfaction that's been an important part of my life and my sexuality and that I think will be an asset if I ever do engage in partner sex.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I am 37 and from Olympia, WA. I am an "over" graduate student working on a new career at Evergreen State College. I am a cultural feminist; a belief in all things goddessy, kind, and generative about Feminism. And I am pro-radical honesty when it comes to issues of sex. I've dealt with being hypersexual all my life from my bipolar disorder. The subject has always interested me and enthralled me, so I know a good deal. Surprisingly it wasn't until I was 32 I was able to master having an orgasm with another person.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

I was born w/o a hymen so I really don't think it has much to do with a cherry getting popped or what-not. It is simply your first intercourse. But I believe it should be your first orgasm, that first moment where you were able to free yourself from all the negative messages about sex and just come together. I didn't have that till I was 25 and I wasn't really comfortable to let go with a partner in the room till 32.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

I always attributed my loss of virginity to my lover's best friend who got me high when I was 19 and completed intercourse with me as I lay there prone and rigid in a cold blue light, like I was watching it from outside my body. I suppose it was I had so much religious shame about sex, so much taught shame that I could not say the words to describe what I needed to enjoy pleasure. I did it because of the religious mythos imparted to the act that there was some mystical bond and it would be ultimate bliss like the movies or a romance novel.

But it was none of that. Just a cold blue light and the feeling of be penetrated lightly and it was over.
Realizing sex was not some magical act that would turn me into some magical princess or bond me to a man forever was a hard lesson. And I found that in my foreplay/heavy petting sessions with my first lover were much more passionate and orgasmic compared to that cold little moment. And so it took me another ten years before I could say "penis" and "vagina" without blushing and where I could take control of my pleasure with my ex-husband.]]></content:encoded>

If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong></span><span style="color: #660000; font-style: italic;">. We'd love to run it in this blog.</span>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a 23-year-old female grad student from Vermont. All the schools I've attended have been public with the exception of my high school, which was Catholic. I was raised Catholic in a politically- but not behaviorally- liberal household.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

The word means little to me. I guess I would say that a virgin is someone who has not had sex. I think that the societal definition is limiting to people who aren't hetero and vague at best to everyone else. I think that my personal definition of sex includes not just the physical aspect, but the emotional closeness as well. It's so much more than just a penis in a vagina (PIV), which is the definition I knew growing up.

I think virginity is not a particularly useful concept. And I think that the virgin/whore and slut/stud dichotomies aren't fair.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

Er, society would say no, and I guess I'm not, but there was definitely no moment that I can look back to and say, "That was it! That was when I lost my virginity!" Sex for me was a very gradual progression towards coitus. I wish that there were a better euphemism for one's first time since I certainly didn't misplace my virginity, but I don't particularly care for the phrase "giving it up" either.

I feel great about sex! I was 20 and this guy and I had been dating for about a year. We were getting progressively closer and closer to piv sex over that period of time. When I saw that it was imminent, I went to my doctor, got on birth control, and then he and I went on our merry way not too long after! It was the first time
for both of us, so it was very sweet and romantic. It hurt quite a lot for a second-I bled a little- and then it felt amazing and wonderful... and then it was over. It didn't last long at all, but subsequent times only got better.

Despite the Catholic upbringing, I miraculously have suffered no guilt from having sex outside of marriage. My first one and I broke up over a year ago, but now I'm dating a marvelous guy and we're having wonderful guilt-free sex. It's been eye-opening going from high-school-me, believing that no self-respecting people could have pre-marital sex, to where I am now in my beliefs.

I took a class at my high school called–no joke–Morality. It was hammered into our heads that people who had had sex before marriage were "damaged" or "used" and would invariably regret past actions. I was surprised to find that sex I've had with someone else in the past has not diminished my sexual experiences with someone else. Catholic school had me thinking that it would matter, but I see now that it doesn't. There comes a point in a relationship when you're so emotionally close that you may as well have had sex, and when you do have sex in that scenario, it changes NOTHING. <em>Y'hear me? Nothing</em>. The messages sent in Morality were of little use to me and I'm thankful that I've overcome my behaviorally conservative upbringing.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm 18, live in Arizona, and I'm a virgin.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Your status before you have sex (including oral).

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

I was raised Catholic, and for a long time, I wanted to wait till after marriage to give myself to my husband. Now I'm thinking in more realistic terms. Believe me, I'd still wait till marriage if that is what we both want, but pre-marital sex is no longer a taboo to me.

I've heard stories of how it will hurt the first time, and even worse stories of how one or the other person is just using the other to get off. These things make me want to be sure in myself and my partner, and be in a committed relationship. Even though I don't think it will be a wedding night deal for me anymore, I still want it to be special. I want it to be more than just trying to get rid of a status that shouldn't define who you are as a person.

I want to end this with a bit of an "Easy A" kind of feel to it. I'm currently dating a very sweet guy right now. I don't know if I'll lose my virginity to him or not. Regardless, it is no one's business.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm nearly 18, a college freshman majoring in Interior Architecture and living in the US

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Haha, as my first relationship developed, so did my definition of this word, just so I would still be able to call myself a virgin. The last thing I labeled it as was when a vagina is fully penetrated by a penis. I do believe homosexuals can lose their virginity to each other, however I haven't developed my own definition for that yet.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

I remember being 15 and knowing, just knowing I would be a virgin until a time after my wedding. Honestly I planned to hide out in the bathroom on the wedding night until the groom was asleep.

Then I met him. Somehow I knew I could trust him and within the first few weeks I told him everything about my darkest secret: I was molested by a family member several times when I was younger. I really think this affected the way he treated me in our relationship when we started dating five months later. He was insistent that sexual doings weren't necessarily bad or scary, and of course that we should do them (horny teenagers right?). That was the full extent of the pressure he put on me to have sex.

Shortly before we started dating we went to prom together, but he didn't dance "on" me. He was worried about scaring me away if I felt a certain part of him. Six months after we started dating, we explored each other's bodies. Though we had talked about it earlier and I agreed to it, he still asked to touch me, and asked again when things went lower. Because of all the stuff out there about girls' first times being unpleasant, he asked me to at least try masturbation.

A year after we began dating we decided on partial penetration. It didn't work out too well. I started going a bit too far but he held back, unwilling to violate our earlier agreement. The next day he did go farther, but still not enough. I said we had already passed our earlier agreement anyway, so why hold off? He wholeheartedly agreed, and it was nice (with a condom, of course).

I did not orgasm then, to his credit he did try to make me after he did. But I only began to get sore. I did cry afterwards; not because I wasn't a virgin anymore, but because I didn't want him to go. So he held me. There weren't any huge sparks and I still didn't orgasm for quite awhile after that, but I loved each time. Plus it only got better, and better, and better.

To this day, he's still careful about hurting me emotionally during sex. I could tell him to stop at ANY point and he would.

But don't think of him as a sweet wuss with no backbone. He looks at me like he's going to eat me and has no qualms about pushing me onto the bed and various other things of that nature.

It occurred to me while reading other first-time articles that mine seems unusually good. I can't believe the unfeeling way some people were treated. It's especially saddening/angering to see that it was/is thought to be normal. I wish more people could have had better first times, more caring partners. He helped heal the scars left from when I was younger and aided my education about safe-sex. I was his first everything. While I'm thankful he was my first kiss and lover, I wish so much that he could have been my first everything as well.

I honestly believe first times are important, not just for sex but for anything we do. Anybody remember a first plane ride? first pet? Sometimes first times suck, but we learn from them. I learned to stick up for myself and then learned how wonderful sex can be.]]></content:encoded>

If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong></span><span style="color: #660000; font-style: italic;">. We'd love to run it in this blog.</span>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm 29 and have not had partnered sex.

I've masturbated, I've read articles, I've been to at least two sex museums and for a number of years I lurked on a few sex-worker blogs before I lost the addresses. I've browsed through porn DVDs/manga/comics, I have books written by sex workers, drag queens and transsexuals.

I currently follow several sexologist news streams on face book, donated pictures of my vulva to be made into vulva art necklaces and actively want a copy of the "How To Lose Your Virginity" DVD.

The only thing I have not done is have sex with a partner. I currently live out of the United States, stationed in Europe living in a military barracks, and my solo sex life could use much improvement but I have a roommate that never leaves.

I do not participate in the party culture. I do not understand them and never enjoyed the times I *tried* to become part of them (I mention this because part of the reason why I still haven't had partner sex is because I mostly avoid being around other people. I can not imagine why this would prevent me from having partner sex. It is a mystery).

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

A first time, a lack of experience. A personal evolution.

If you never been in combat–you are a virgin. If you never been hunting–you are a virgin. If you've never been out of country or state or home town–you are a virgin. If you never done something before–you are a virgin. Once you have, you are changed. You know. You've experienced. You've gotten out of your house and lived a life.

Virginity is not sexual, it is experience gained and ignorance lost. We are all virgins to various forms of information and experiences. There is no shame in "losing" virginity, but there is shame in clinging to ignorance.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

I am not waiting for a 'someone.' My social skills are non-existent, honestly I wouldn't know what to do with a 'someone' once I found them.

I've heard people talk about their sex lives. Most seem to make it a point to say how much they like not like having sex. This confuses me–why have sex when you do not like it? Why have sex with someone you don't even like? Why have sex and not orgasm and convince yourself that "the Great Orgasm" is a thing of myth and settle for an unfulfilled sex life?

I do not like the culture of virgin bashing any more than I like non-virgin bashing. Neither one is better than the other. It makes it very hard to talk directly about sex. Because as I have never had "the real thing" I am an object. Something to be praised, pitied, fetishisized, blown off, lectured, condemned, to be bullied or ignored.

Both recent times I've been "outed" I ended up getting a winding lecture what I think was suppose to be a complement...to some thing (I think the guy's ego because it was more condescending then anything). The other more or lest made an offer to the tune of "if it doesn't go in, it is not cheating" (he was engaged) and of course, he intentions were honorable so if anything *hint* *hint* was going to happen *hint*, then *I* would be the one to initiate it.

Just because I have not had partner sex, does not mean I am stupid. But, apparently in a way it does. I've had a lot of damage done to my thinking and ability to process information on the subject while growing up that I am working on undoing. I have been trained and programed to live in fear and to *not* have sex, let alone talk about it and enjoy it. Talking about it helps...some. It's a start.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I am 24 years old and live in Portland, Oregon. I am an aspiring sexologist.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Virginity is subjective. When people ask me at what age I lost my virginity, I always ask, "that depends on what you consider sex." The answer to that question determines the answer because I was having oral sex with I was 12, but had heterosexual intercourse when I was 14.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

I remember being so excited and afraid about losing my virginity. Like most young girls, I wanted it to be "special" but it was anything but. I am still unclear as to when I lost my virginity and what exactly I did to lose it (was it oral sex? intercourse? manual sex?) and I find it so interesting the sex acts girls do to "avoid" losing their virginity. From oral to anal, young women everywhere are having sex but saying it "doesn't count" based on a hetero-normative definition of sex. It's interesting and confusing at the same time. When DID I lose my virginity? 12? 14? Or maybe even 23 when I first had anal sex? Are there different "types" of virginity? I don't know. And I don't think it matters really when or how I "lost" it. Because I don't feel I lost anything. I gained a sexual self, knowledge, and experience.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a 26-year-old female currently living in New York City.

<strong>How do you define virginity?  </strong>

I've always defined virginity the technical way: oral or penetrative sex between two people.  But apart from that, you can be a _____ virgin, like a kissing virgin or an anal virgin, etc.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

I'm a virgin (in the technical sense that I've never been penetrated by a penis; I own a size-able dildo and I unwittingly broke my own hymen when I was 13) who recently moved to NYC from the Midwest United States.  Not only am I a virgin, I've never kissed a man or so much as held hands.

I have a love-hate relationship with my virginity; some days I feel like the biggest saddest freak in the world, the girl who can't handle human intimacy, because everyone else makes hopping into the sack look so EASY.  It's easy for me to look at the hook-up and casual sex culture and get disappointed in society, although perhaps I don't have the right to be.

And then there's some days where I feel really proud of myself, not because I'm "pure" or anything, but because I simply haven't allowed myself to be coerced by peer pressure or media or dates into doing something I'm not sure I want to do yet.  I'm a bit of a private person, and I've personally never had the urge to sleep with someone I wasn't emotionally involved with.  I've never had fantasies of sex that didn't involve genuine love, caring, and intimacy, even the kinky ones.

I'm not one to tell people what to do, but personally I feel like sex in any other context is just people using each other (which, again, is fine between two consenting people but I don't think it's for me).  So I guess I'm not so much 'waiting for the right person' as I am 'looking for someone who values me as a person and has the mental maturity and clarity to want to provide what I need and to accept what I can provide'.  When I find someone who I like who has the capacity to care for me and accept my care for them, then I'll feel ready.  The fact that I'm a virgin wouldn't be something I would disclose to someone right away, either.  Let them earn that trust first.

I almost lost my virginity late last year to a guy I had been dating for a little while.  He had a number of red flags flying and made short work of manipulating and bullying me with the goal of doing sexual things with me. When I told him I was a virgin he was incredulous and called me names.  I felt like shit for a while but eventually I found out he had just lost his that past summer and he was my age, so I think he was self-hating and took it out on me.  Anyhow, it was a very toxic relationship that I broke off before so much as holding his hand.  Frankly I still feel like I dodged a bullet there.

I might fall to pieces the first time I have sex so I want it to be with someone I trust.  I don't have time for guys who think I just have a nice rack, because guess what? When I take my bra off they sag and so he'd better be able to love that part just as much.

I don't sleep around, drink, or smoke, but I swear like a sailor and I own a variety of sex toys that would make my mother cry if she ever saw them. I've explored my own sexuality very thoroughly, I just haven't found someone I want to share it with yet. I want companionship because even though sex is vital to romantic relationships, the novelty of it does wear off.  I also think that girls who have sex "to get it over with" (and I've known a few) are missing the point of sharing that intimacy between two people.  Sticking to your values is most important. I'm going to make some guy very happy, even if I don't meet him until I'm 40 (I really hope it doesn't take that long, though).]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

A 24 year old from Detroit, Michigan. I work as a home health care provider while finishing my degree in English Lit for Secondary Education.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Vaginal Intercourse. Otherwise, I think I lost mine at 6 playing house in the garage. So lets go with Vaginal Intercourse.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

I lost my virginity at 16 to my high school sweetheart who now...just so happens to be my husband.

Our story is a romantic one. We met at 12, started dating at 15 and married at 23. We went to a nearby university and both studied education and then my husband received a masters fellowship at 23. We bought a dog and lovely cape cod with a privacy fence for a quarter of what it was going for five years ago (all thanks to the crashing economy).

The story of our mutual loss of virginity however, is not.

We were on the carpeted floor of my bedroom and my parents came home and were rummaging around the kitchen at some point. There was never any pressure on his end, any pressure I felt was purely in my own head. What if we don't stay together? What If I am sinning? (Which is funny, because I'm not what anyone would describe as a religious person) What if sucks so bad he tells people? What if he is so terrible that I will become completely turned off by him.

The one thing I never thought was "What if he thinks I'm a whore" which I'm endlessly grateful for for since it seemed to be on many of my other friends minds. We were sixteen and had already been dating for eight months. Which as most of us know is an ETERNITY when you are sixteen.

I felt like there was so much pressure on me to make the right decision. Finally, I just decided that if this was a mistake than it was my mistake to make and that no matter what came of it. I would have no regrets.

As soon as I decided, I jumped him right there on a very uncomfortable carpet floor. Trust Me, he didn't mind.

It's funny because in a way I think making that one decision for myself helped to shape me into the person I am now. When I make decisions I always try to make ones that I can live with. After all my own virginity had nothing to do with my parents, teachers, friends or God.

It's my damn vagina. They can get their own.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a 22 year old from Barcelona, Spain attending college in New York City.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

I don't know, what was my virginity? I never really give it that much thought. I was more excited to have my first boyfriend than to lose it to him. He was in fact the first person that ever said he liked me.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

My virginity was lost in a Friday afternoon to my first boyfriend when I was 15. We were both so nervous that it kind of didn't go right the first time. I think he was more nervous than I was. Looking back it was a little pathetic and short and not as pleasant as sex is today.

But it wasn't that big of a deal, I did told my friends and it was kind of special but I didn't feel different or grown up.

I guess it's because my sex education was completely different from the education American girls go through. The first year I entered high school I was 13, and every year until graduation we had a sex ed day. Some men and women from the public health department came into our class and taught us about condoms (they even gave us samples), diseases, pregnancy and sex in general.

The first year it was special since after the introduction on sex, diseases and different contraceptives methods they put girls and boys in different classes and teaches us (the girls) about our menstruation, and what we should expect our first time.

It was totally embarrassing and I had tons of question that of course I didn't ask because talking about sex was and is taboo. A year after the same women came back and they told us all about condoms, contraceptive methods, diseases, etc all over again but this time they add a school trip to the nearest public health center where they explain what they did, what we should do if we had unprotected sex, but more important they remark that they were here to help all of us, girls and boys, and that we could come anytime for question, revisions or the day after pill.

I remember they seemed really nice and it was comfortable. At the end of the trip our homeroom teacher told us we will be doing an essay about contraceptive methods for men and women and diseases. So basically at the age of 14 I had to Google all about safe sex and what happens when you don't use a condom. The pictures scared me even more than I thought.

At the end when it was my turn, it didn't feel forced and I knew that I should use protection and where to get it. And even after I lost it those nice women came each year to my school and update us on the latest about safe sex. Because we were teenagers, at that age you are changing and your hormones are working 150% is almost impossible to prevent sex but you can make it safe. And I think that is the most important thing.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I am a 21 year old college student from Northern California, born in San Francisco and moved to Humboldt County. I am a dancer and plan to go professional after college.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Never having had vaginal sex yet for heterosexual women. It gets fuzzy when talking about other sexualities. I do believe that from a health stand point that there are many different versions of sex, like anal and oral.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

I wanted to lose it the summer before I left for college... that didn't work. I tried half-heartedly and came to college an 18-year-old virgin. About three weeks into school me and my floor mates were all drinking in the hallways. One tall skinny white boy was talking to me, John. He used a great pick up line, "Have you seen my room?" I found out quickly how easy it is to have sex in college.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a 20 year old college student from New Jersey

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

My friends and I always say that virginity is a state of mind. So many people have so many different concepts of what their virginity was that to me, a state of mind seems to sum it up pretty nicely.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

I lost my virginity at the age of 19 to a guy I was dating for 3 months. He broke up with me a week afterward, making me feel disgusting and used. Because of the way society treats virginity, my first thoughts after the break up were "I gave him everything I had and he rejected it."

This is a horrible thought to have. To feel like your one valuable asset is your virginity. But the way I was raised had me thinking that once I had sex, that was it. Especially because I was brought up very religiously, and my religion teacher taught the girls of my class to save it for our future husbands.

But as time passed I realized I am not my virginity. I am a person and I have value and I am worth so much more than I was lead to believe by my religious upbringing. My sense of value no longer is based on my value to men. And it's liberating as hell. I think that society needs to stop putting so much stress on virginity so no girls have to go through the horrible thought process I went through.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a 22 year old college student at Humboldt State University in California with one year left of school. I can not wait to graduate!

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

I define virginity as penetration of the vagina with a penis.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

As a 22 year old college student I get weird looks whenever I tell people that I'm a virgin, so I stopped telling people. It doesn't really come up on conversation a lot and when it does I change the subject. I didn't take any sort of pledge but it's never felt right for me. I actually have never had a boyfriend, I used to be a shy and kind of awkward person and that excuse got me out of being too depressed in high school for being single, but I've grown a bit now and had a couple of dates, but they always go running when I tell them I've never had sex and I want to wait until it feels like the right time.

I'm not some sort of prude, like some people think I am, I just want it to mean something. It is a big deal to be that intimate with someone, to share all your secrets (you have a mole there?!?) and to trust someone that much takes time. Is it so crazy that I want to be in love with the person I have sex with? I hope not, because that's how I feel. I don't think I will wait until marriage, because I'd feel like I was just getting married so I could have sex. I just really wish everyone would stop judging me for being a virgin, it's not that big of a deal, I'm just waiting for the right guy.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

My age is 20 and I live in California.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

I define virginity as not having had sexual intercourse.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

My story is that I am still a virgin due to several reasons. The one I tell myself the most is that I still have yet to have the right opportunity and circumstances. It so far has always been that I do not reciprocate the feelings to the guys that have liked me. And if I do they never tell me how they feel and/or end up moving away.

The next reason is that while I am not waiting for any religious reason, I still want to wait to have sex with someone I really connect with.

And the third and most unfortunate reason of all is that I am terribly self conscious of my keratosis pilaris, or chicken skin. It is mainly on my upper arms and legs. It is not as bad as it was when I was younger but I picked at my skin so much that I still have scars on my thighs. I am absolutely embarrassed by it and I can't imagine that someone would start to be intimate with me and not be grossed out by it.

Despite all this I have an incredibly high sex drive and I think about it all the time. It's becoming embarrassing now that I live in a house of sexually active females and I'm "The Virgin."]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I am 27 years old, and am in graduate school in Pittsburgh, PA.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Virginity is the essence of purity, naivety, and lack of sexual/intimate experience. When I was younger, I simply thought it was vaginal intercourse.

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

When I look back, I truly lost my essence of purity in my first year of college, at a gradual rate. I was interested in my own sexual energy, and connecting with others on a sexual level. At the time I thought I was still a virgin because I had never been penetrated by a penis, but even my boyfriend, when I told him I was a virgin, said he was surprised because I emitted such sexual energy. When we finally had sex, it was for only about 40 seconds, and was fairly disappointing. I had much more meaningful sexual experiences with him simply making out.]]></content:encoded>

We rarely get <a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/category/first-person/">First Person</a> submissions from gay guys (c'mon guys!), so I was really glad <a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/2011/11/why-doesnt-anyone-ever-talk-about-edward-cullens-virginity/">blog contributor</a> and fellow virginity geek <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/j_a_allan" target="_blank">Jonathan Allan</a> told us about this post featuring several <a href="http://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/what-does-virginity-mean-to-gay-men/">candid videos</a> of gay men giving their own definitions of virginity. And guess what? They're as diverse as the definitions we get from everyone else! Plus there are a lot of diverse quotes as well, including this one which we especially liked:

<em><strong>It bothers me that there is a difference between gay and straight virginity. If you care about someone enough and are intimate with them for the first time, you’re no longer a virgin. A penis doesn’t have to go into a specific hole. As soon as clothes come off and you’ve got two naked people wondering what to do next, you’ve hit home run, baby.</strong></em>

We'd love to run it in this blog.</span>

I thought of you the other day...can you guess why? According to the hetero-normative definition, I can no longer count myself among the sisterhood of virgins.

I wanted to tell you that I'm *so* glad our conversations on the subject of virginity preceded my first experience with hetero sex. I believe our conversations contextualized the experience for me–significantly released my first experience with sex from the unhealthy, fabricated hype of "losing virginity," and brought the choice into the same realm of choice I have always had to engage in other sexual acts. My experience was fine–fun, even.

I didn't tell the guy that it was my first time, partially because I was, admittedly, shy about that fact, but mostly because I didn't think it really mattered. The encounter was casual, light, with a friend to whom I don't feel extremely close, but with whom I feel comfortable, safe and playful. I discovered that I definitely prefer oral sex.

I'm going to encourage my mom to watch your film when it comes out. I just discovered how squeamish she is around the subject. When I told her about my recent experience, she said, "Finally. Mazel Tov..." and proceeded to ask me to spare her the details, because she is my mother, after all, not my friend, and goodness knows we need to respect certain boundaries. This coming from a psychologist and child of the '60s and feminist movement. Oy!]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:  </strong>

I will be 21 in a few days. I am currently living in Las Vegas, but originally from California.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Never acting in a more platonic way to a person of sexual interest. Having never kissed someone, I believe there are several types of virginity.

<strong>Tell us your story:</strong>

I will be 21 in less than a week and I am still a virgin. I have never even held hands with a guy. I was always the different one in school, and I've done most of my life backwards. I was the ugly duckling in high school, and I haven't grown into the "swan". I graduated high school at 16, and college at 18. At that point I didn't put pressure on myself to get a boyfriend; I naively thought that it would just happen.

After college I moved to Paris, also known as "the city of love", for everyone but me. Even abroad, there wasn't a single person I was interested in. I moved around some more and finally ended up in Vegas, the single most disgusting city in the world (seriously, the locals here are like characters from a Rob Zombie film). Alas, I am eager to lose my virginity as 21 is really pushing it, but the problem is I have no guys who are interested. I am on several online dating sites, and no bites.

I keep myself up, and I'm not the worst thing out there, but it's very competitive. I'm also very tall and severe looking so that intimidates guys a lot. Being a virgin sucks simply for the fact that having sex is the most primal and normal of basic humans needs. To be a female and not be able to attract a guy for sex is really saying a lot. If I can't get a guy now while I am young and fertile, how am I going to get a guy when I'm older?

I think the media puts so much pressure on people about sex, because it's everywhere. Every ad has a sexual inneundo. Sex sells, especially in Vegas, and not being able to participate is like being deprived of water simply because the cap is still sealed. I've recently begun to think about losing it to a random guy in a bar to get it over with. I honestly don't think I'll have a boyfriend so there's no point in waiting for something that is never going to happen.

Being a virgin in today's society is more of a burden then a "gift", and the idea of being pure is a novelty that has run dry. How can someone be pure in this world when sex is all around us even if it's not happening to us? I don't think people should wait for that "special someone", because life is not a fairy tale, it is what you make of it. It's a experience that everyone should get the pleasure of trying, and to have to resort to uncomfortable measures as going to a bar is definitely a low point. Losing it in high school would probably be the easiest and safest way.

If I could say one thing to my former high school self I would say, " you only live once, you might as well do it right the first time, find a guy, be safe, and enjoy. If you wait too long, you'll be too tall to ride, and life's tickets will run out. The carnival doesn't stay in town forever, go while you still have a chance."]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I can empathize with much of this post. It's difficult when life is made to seem like one big party and you don't feel invited -- and it must be doubly so living in "Sin City." Virgins are seen as freaks, and it must take some doing to be considered a freak in Las Vegas.

Telling you to keep your chin up and believe in yourself would just sound hollow and patronizing, but I would ask why you are so convinced your lack of male companionship now means you'll always be so. A person's 20s tend to be among the most dramatic years of change, and I'd wager that anyone intelligent and capable enough to graduate from college at 18 has it within them to adapt and thrive among those changes.

That line about "the carnival doesn't stay in town forever" sounds an awful lot like the old Japanese saying comparing women and Christmas cake -- after the 25th, no one wants either. It's just so, so wrong. You're not going to "dry up" if you spend your 20s focusing on being a better you and getting a better idea of what you want out of life instead of using it before you lose it. If anything, that time spent bettering yourself will make you more attractive to the kinds of people you want to attract. Like you said, life is what you make of it.]]></wp:comment_content>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm 24 years old, and I currently live in Minnesota.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

I think that each person has to decide what virginity means for them. My relative virginity ebbed and flowed depending on my mindset and philosophy. I tend to think now that it's not easy to decide who IS a virgin: it's a lot easier to pick out someone who is NOT a
virgin. So, basically, my own personal philosophy is that you're not a virgin anymore when you no longer feel like a virgin, when you've
undergone some kind of experience (any kind) that makes you feel different, like you've crossed a milestone, or that makes you sufficiently knowledgeable or experienced that it would feel silly to call yourself a virgin.

<strong>Tell us your story:</strong>

I lost my virginity relatively recently at the age of 24. A classic late bloomer, I had been waiting so long for the "right guy" or the "right moment" that I had suddenly found myself in my mid-twenties and still a virgin. I started to feel ridiculous and ashamed of my prolonged abstinence. It felt like a failure, like I had missed some landmark that I should have passed by now. This was despite the fact that I had many friends who were also still virgins or who had been virgins into their twenties -- we talked about this frequently but were somehow never able to find any solace in our shared fate.

Finally, I had decided I was pretty sick of being ashamed and of holding back and of waiting. So one night, while feeling particularly attractive and happy, I drank my fair share of gin and tonics and went to bed with a friend of a friend, someone I liked and trusted but was by no means in love with. I'm not saying the decision was easy. I had spent so much of my life holding back and running from sex that it was a hard habit to break. But after a little motivational speech in the bathroom mirror, I had sex and it was fun. I didn't tell him I was a virgin and I have no reason to believe he had any "suspicions" (which is actually how I thought of it -- I was a fraud, pretending to be someone that I wasn't, pretending to know what I was doing when I didn't).

When it was over, my first reaction was one of elation and relief. It turned out that this was as close to the "right guy" and the "right moment" as I could have hoped for under the circumstances. But I also felt a little annoyed that I hadn't done it sooner. The fact that I was a virgin had stopped me from having sex many times. Mostly, I had been terrified of being rejected when a potential sexual partner found out my dark secret. But now the milestone had passed, I wished I'd gotten it over with a lot sooner and saved myself the psychological agony, the years of feeling shame and embarrassment.

I still feel this way, but another regret has wormed its way into my conscience and has surprised me. In part due to conversations with friends who admitted never "owning" their virginity and in part due to discovering <em>How to Lose Your Virginity</em>, I am now beginning to regret that I was never able to be comfortable with my virginity. It's not that I should have been proud of it —- because, honestly, that would have been asking too much. I wish that I could have at least been more compassionate with myself for being unable or unwilling to have sex before I did. I would be going too far to say that I wish I was still a virgin so I could find that piece of mind. I had fun losing my virginity, but I do wish I found the strength within myself to be happy as a virgin and to fight back against the nagging feeling that I was somehow broken because I hadn't managed to have sex. I hope <em>How to Lose Your Virginity</em> can help others like me find that self-confidence and inner peace that I never found.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:  </strong>

I am a 21 year old Malagasy-European, studying in the U.S who loves politics, the arts and Rihanna. I'm currently in the Wild Wild West, more specifically in the state of Texas.

<strong>How do you define virginity?  </strong>

I look at my private hole, and if it has been entered by anyone else's privates, I consider that losing my virginity. However, it is both a mental and physical thing. Because we are not just animals, our human minds control a lot of what we believe and how things are conceived. I believe a woman can erase the act of intercourse out of her mind, and make herself a new virgin if she chooses to.

<strong>Tell us your story:</strong>

There are stories of rape, and I believe mine happens to be a mild example of one. I lost my virginity in a bathroom stall to a high school senior when I was just 14. I went in the stall with him thinking we were going to kiss and what have you, but as things heated up I wasn't fully prepared for his privates entering mine. When he stripped me down, he told me to sit, and as he pressed me down on him, I told him it hurt. He told me to hush, and that it's supposed to hurt.

Since then, I've had a terrible view on how sex was supposed to be enjoyed. I had an even more screwed up view on how I was compared to my virgin friends, how they seemed better than me because they hadn't "given it up yet." I feel like I didn't have a choice in my V-card, so I resented my non-virginity, and because it was something "that you could never get back" I continued my "unpure" sexuality, since it was already lost anyway.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:  </strong>

I am a 18 year old college student in New Hampshire.

<strong> How do you define virginity?</strong>

It's really hard to define virginity because everyone views it in different ways. My view would be that losing your virginity is having vaginal intercourse, but I have heard virginity defined in many ways (anal and oral).

<strong>Tell us your story</strong>

It seems that after 18 years, I am still a virgin as a freshman in college. Before college, I had not had much education about virginity, sex, etc, To educate myself, I looked up certain terms that I heard people refer to, and eventually I did look up porn, but sex seemed so out there for a senior in high school. So, until I made it until college, sex did not really mean anything and losing virginity seemed to
be on the back burner of my mind.

This all changed as soon as I went to college. I was thrown into the drinking, social scene culture of college where guys and girls could
casually have sex and be totally fine with it. Of course, alcohol reinforced this culture. What was I going to do as a virgin trying to navigate through this culture where being a freshman is one of the most desirable things for guys to prey on?

Something like virginity that seemed so abstract to me before college turned into a top priority for me. I heard stories about how even the most unsociable people were "getting it in" as I remained a complete "prude." I wanted to lose my virginity as I slowly became more and more horny, but I did not want to partake in the drinking culture that resulted in possible sexual assault or health complications due to alcohol (something my mother also advocated against).

I was close to losing it with a guy who seemed a little happier than he usually was, but nothing came out of it. I worry about the day when I do choose to lose the big V. What happens if the guy is a pro with sex and I am the noob? What happens if it is not what I expected? Will it ever happen? Until it happens, the questions have yet to happen but I hope that the big V will be taken before I become the prude/noob I fear that I might become.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:  </strong>

I turn 29 in July. I work in the S/W industry writing programs,tools and APIs for computers, networking devices etc. I have been a shy kid since my teens, and often keep to myself. Part of the reason for shyness is because of the negative reinforcement from mom about taboo topics, words etc..

<strong>How do you define virginity?  </strong>

Never having had sexual intercourse with a woman.

<strong>Tell us your story:</strong>

Naturally, I spent time in libraries reading as voraciously as I could (favorites being jokes/humour/philosophy etc..). Then I moved out of home for college, but ended up in a course with a male:female ratio of 11:1. So obviously, the library became the refuge as I escaped all the competition and developed a defensive superiority complex. It's been 7 years since then, and I've been in 3/4 relationships, but it's been awkward due to lack of experience. But I've been kissed and reached second base.

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I am 24 years old, and I live in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

<strong>How do you define virginity?  </strong>

I went to a school with a very high teen pregnancy rate in Wyoming, MI. I promised myself that I would not lose my virginity before I left high school because I was scared SHITLESS of becoming pregnant and ending up like the other girls in my class: teen moms with babies and, in my petty mind, no future.  So, in a sense, as a younger and not-so-feminist version of me, I saw my virginity as something to hold on to because it would get in the way of my success, thus defining my womanhood through this single sexual act.  I now see that I used it as a way to distinguish myself from an identity I longed to escape.  Now I see that virginity=power, and, sadly, I think it signifies the power that society has over women and their bodies.

<strong>Tell us your story:</strong>

I was in a monogamous relationship with my high school sweetheart; let's call him "Chad".  We had fooled around during our two year tryst, but no serious business and no sex.  The minute I packed up for college, I had sex, sex, sex on the brain and I knew it was on his
too.  Although we never made an official plan, we both knew we were going to lose our virginities when he came up during my first week of school for a big football game, and our first time without "adult" supervision.

We, being the classiest of couples, booked a hotel room in a town near my college.  Before he arrived, I did what was expected of a girl losing her virginity: bought matching underwear (which, by the way, was going the extra mile because I wore sports bras from age 11 to age 17).  I dressed in my cutest outfit, put on more make-up than I had ever had, and packed an overnight bag with my sexiest sleep shorts and tank top (I still don't wear negligees...).  On the 20 minute drive to the hotel, my mind raced with expectations and fears, with the pervasive thought of "FUCK, FUCK, FUCK, I should have grabbed condoms from the health center before I left".

We arrived at the hotel, paid up front (with my credit card, by the way) and proceeded upstairs. We entered into the stale-smelling room with the yellowed ceiling and the green-flowed bedspread that make all cringe.  We looked at each other, shrugged, and proceeded to make out.  He was the first person I had ever undressed in front of and, to be honest, neither one of us had a fucking clue what we were doing.  But, at one point, probably before the pants came off, I said, "Dude, we need to stop and get condoms" and Chad's simple response was to grab a box of Trojans from his duffle and chuckle as he said, "I came prepared".  We finally figured out how to put it on him and when he slid into me, I laughed because I didn't know what else to do.]]></content:encoded>

Virginity to me has always been in the physical sense. Losing one's virginity consists of having penetrative sexual intercourse or the equivalent thereof if you aren't heterosexual. I'm not religious, nor was I brought up that way, so I tend to see things like that in more of a scientific, straight forward light.

<strong>Tell us your story: </strong>

I was quite a troublesome kid when I was younger. I ran with a bad crowd and I did a lot of dumb things such as developing a drug dependency when I was 15. My parents were very busy when I was younger; my mum worked nights as well so I could get away with a lot of stuff without them ever knowing what was going on. I lost pretty much all control of my life at that point, apart from my virginity. I wanted to hold on to that one piece of me that I felt was the only thing I had going to keep me somewhat happy with myself.

Most of the people I hung out with were older and sexually active (had been for a while) and used that to their advantage. I always tended to be the younger one in the group, so eventually to stop from getting teased or disowned by my "friends", I lied when I was 16 that when I'd gone away for summer, I'd lost my virginity. I had a whole story, got the guy (who was one of my only decent friends) to agree to go along with it if they ever asked or caught up with him about it. I managed to keep that story up with most people to this day. Because I live in a relatively small city compared to other countries, my friends now are people I've known almost my whole life. So most of my friends now assume that I did lose my virginity when I was younger like they did, and I've never had the courage to correct them.

Once I ended up getting my shit together and got off the drugs, I was about 18. I met a guy and all of our friends became a group who hung out a lot. One night, there were a few of us around at his house and they decided to go looking for some food. Us two decided to stay back. I don't even know why, I was never really attracted to him in that sense until that night when he kissed me. It didn't go much further, and we just slept in the same bed. My reputation, unfortunately, proceeded me and after hanging out for about 6 months with no luck (obviously), he finally asked me if I was a virgin after all. I owned up, said yes, and he said he'd wait for me. And he did, for at least a year and a half after that conversation.

Looking back, he was amazing about it and I wish more guys would be able to do that for girls. When I had just turned 20, I felt ready in myself and the fact that I had control over my life again made it easier for me to give that part of me up for good. I never would have done it had I felt I wasn't healthy and prepared to remain healthy, which I have so far. I'm 4 years and 3 months sober, and I am still friends with the guy I lost my virginity with. It was uncomfortable, but I don't regret it one bit and I'm so proud of that fact.]]></content:encoded>

If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong></span><span style="color: #660000; font-style: italic;">. We'd love to run it in this blog.</span>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:  </strong>

I'm a 22-year-old female living in New York and I'm starting my senior year of college this fall. I lost my virginity at 20, and I've recently decided to abstain until marriage on my own terms.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

For me, first PIV (penis-in-vagina) sex. There are so many gray areas and exceptions that I could never define virginity for anyone else but myself.

<strong>Tell us your story:</strong>

I've always considered myself sexually aware and discovered masturbation in my early teens. In my second year of college I was brave enough to purchase a vibrator, which made me feel awesome about myself and empowered. I considered my sex life as a virgin very fulfilling and because of that I thought I was ready to have intercourse.

The young man I lost my virginity to was in the same major as me and we both worked at the TV station on campus. Over the course of two weeks I started exploring with him, and to his credit he stopped whenever I wasn't ready to go further. The night I lost my virginity, I was the one who asked to have sex. I was scared and nervous, which I didn't tell him. He thought I was mature and empowered (I was! but also scared and vulnerable) and he didn't think virginity was a big deal to me. The sex was not great or special; I was too nervous to enjoy myself and cried myself to sleep afterwards. I was devastated and was depressed for several months afterwards.

Looking back on it now, I know why I became depressed. A question kept nagging me: "If I am so comfortable with my own sexuality, why was having sex for the first time such a big deal that it broke me emotionally?" Right? I enjoyed my sexuality as a virgin so much and was so satisfied. But bringing another person into the equation was so much less enjoyable - why?

I can tell you now that I was NOT emotionally ready to be intimate with someone else. My ideal of being able to do whatever I pleased sexually fell short of the pressures that society (aka, my peer group) immediately slammed on me. "What?! You lost your virginity to some random guy?" "It wasn't even special?" "He doesn't even want you to be his girlfriend?" Not to mention that I had to hide all of this from my family and friends back home, so what I was originally excited about turned out to be a source of shame and lies. I found myself isolated and heartbroken. It was a really shitty situation.

The silver lining of this is that I learned a lot about what sex and virginity means to me. My "virginity" is long gone, and as far as I'm concerned, good riddance! The most important thing I've learned about myself is that just because I'm sexually aware of myself and feel empowered, I do NOT have to be ashamed of wanting sexual intercourse to be special and important, and reserved for marriage. I've heard a lot of mixed messages telling me otherwise. (If you're a virgin, you should be pure and innocent and non-sexual until marriage. Oh, but that means you're a prude. If you're sexually empowered, you should have sex whenever and with whoever you want. Oh, but that means you're a slut. All of these are lies and myths taught to us by society.)

I hope that my story will reach someone out there and help them feel like they're not alone, and don't have to be ashamed of what sexuality and virginity means to them!]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a female, in my late 20's, and from the United States.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

I don't think there's any one act that causes virginity to be 'lost.' When sexual experiences are no longer something to simply dream about or giggle over, you're probably not a virgin anymore.

<strong>Tell us your story:</strong>

It always upsets me to hear about women who undergo surgery to "replace" their hymen, and for more reasons than those already stated here. Want an unbreakable, impenetrable hymen? Take mine, please!

When I was younger, I never used tampons because I had trouble inserting them, but I was assured this was normal and nothing to worry about. I never had the desire to try inserting anything else because it was always so uncomfortable, sometimes painful. Then, in college, I had a serious boyfriend. We did lots of fun things physically, but when we tried to have intercourse, it was like he was hitting a wall. Because he was.

Three gynecologists later, I found out I had a rigid hymen and having it surgically removed was the best option as even the slightest attempt to stretch it caused immense pain. Surgery wasn't the magical solution to pain-free sex I'd hoped it would be (to be fair, the surgeon did tell me it wasn't going to be an instant fix), but it certainly made things a lot easier. Good riddance, hymen!]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:  </strong>

I'm an 18-year-old university student from London, England.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

The first act of vaginal intercourse involving a penis. For some reason, I don't consider oral sex to be sex (although I actually didn't partake until after I'd lost my virginity anyway).

<strong>Tell us your story:</strong>

In my second week of university, I went clubbing with some friends, but I'd accidentally left my ID at home. I farewelled them and went to a bar with some other friends, who were more willing to just go to places I could actually get into. Anyway, we were in this dark, sleazy bar and I was buying a mojito, and all of a sudden I couldn't see my friends. Then a guy sidled up to me - his name was Alex. I made out with him for most of the night after that, and then he offered to take me back to his place, but I refused. I got his number though.

A couple of days later, he texted me. I was sick of being a virgin, so I agreed to go to his house. I knew what "fooling around" entailed, and he seemed exceptionally keen. So was I. It hurt a bit, but it lasted for a long time and he had endless fun teaching me all sorts of positions. Despite the initial pain and slight ache (I later described intercourse as "having your insides assaulted with a blunt instrument"), I enjoyed it. It wasn't special, but it was enjoyable, and I think that was what counted.

After a few weeks stewing over my Catholic guilt, I saw him again. We now meet up most weeks. While occasionally I grapple with the realities of such a casual relationship, I don't mind, and for the most part it is enjoyable experimentation.

He didn't tell me his age until afterwards though. He'll be 26 in July. That did make me feel slightly dirty.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a 22-year-old female college senior living in Iowa.

<strong>How do you define virginity? </strong>

Penile-vaginal penetration, I suppose. But that's just a personal definition for myself. I think virginity varies from person to person, especially if someone does not identify as heterosexual. I also believe someone can still consider him or herself a virgin even if they were raped, because losing your virginity should be a personal decision.

<strong>Tell us your story </strong>

I lost my virginity last summer when I was 21. It's not that I hadn't had any opportunities before that, but I wanted my first time to be with the right person. I recognized this guy as the right person almost immediately, and we had sex three days after we met. He was also a virgin, and like most people's first times, ours was a bit awkward, but we laughed it off and tried again. I experienced no pain or bleeding. Afterwards, we just laid there and talked for hours. I'll always remember that night as fun and romantic.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:  </strong>

I'm a 23 year old University student from Australia.

<strong>How do you define virginity?  </strong>

I think virginity in terms of a girl's hymen is just a thing–I probably lost mine at 8 or 9 when I started to horse ride. I think virginity in terms of sex is the moment you have sex with someone and you realise that you feel really comfortable with them and you're not being self-conscious about how you look, how much noise you're making, what he's thinking, etc. It's the divide between not knowing yourself and knowing yourself, if that makes sense.

<strong>Tell us your story:</strong>

I had been talking to my sister and realised that I didn't want to still be a virgin when I was 25, so when I finally got my first boyfriend at 21 I decided that sex was on the cards. About three months into our relationship he looked at me like I was an alien when I told him I was still a virgin.

Then, when we finally did get around to having sex, it was extremely painful for me and I asked him to stop. The relationship from then revolved around him asking for sex and me being extremely reluctant because sex with him was unpleasant and I always felt pressured to have sex with him even when I didn't necessarily want it. Eventually we had a massive argument because he thought I should just 'get over it' and, to steal a phrase from another one of your 'First Person' stories, I basically told him that it was my vagina and he could go screw himself.

So on the whole I probably should have waited a little longer and chosen my partner more carefully. I didn't think my partner would be an issue–after all, all boys have penises, right, and there's only so many things you can do with it–but I realise now that my virginity wasn't necessarily about having sexual intercourse for the first time but about having some sort of meaningful intimacy with a partner, regardless of what sort of relationship you have with them outside of that moment.

Having had a .... disappointing first sexual encounter isn't a barrier though. I am, and have always been, extremely happy to talk about sex with my friends. I am not shy with my viewpoints and I have a very active solo sex life that has definitely given me the time to find out what I want, what I like and what I don't. I haven't been hanging out for a new man waiting to sweep me up and make sweet, passionate love to me because frankly that's unrealistic (unlike other female members of my extended family who are extremely religious and are always telling me to "grab" a man because I'm not going to be young and pretty forever, you know).

I also don't necessarily believe that being in a committed relationship is the only way to have sex. I recently had the best sex of my life with someone I'd only known for a week. It's not going to develop into anything further but that doesn't lessen the fact that I had a very meaningful sexual relationship with him. And all of this is stuff I wouldn't necessarily have concluded if I hadn't had my experiences with my first boyfriend.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Nyasha, 18-year-old woman, Zimbabwe:</strong>

I began my University education in March. I define virginity as the condition before one's vagina has been penetrated by a penis. I recently lost my virginity to someone I'm not sure I even love. I lost my cool and became scared when he brought his penis to my opening, but I couldn't say no. The penetration was painful, so I pushed him away. I'm not even sure if he got to the hymen. I don't want anyone to know because I'm such a disgrace, but I can't keep it to myself either.

<strong>Summer-Rose, 19-year-old-woman, NSW, Australia:</strong>

I dunno how I define virginity. I was 12 and I went to a big massive party of my older brother's, who was sixteen at the time,  party and he had a really nice friend and his brother was so hot. He took me to the park, then we walked to his house. We went  into his room and he pulled out a condom and said "care to use it?" I didn't want sex, I wanted a relationship first, but he took my speechlessness as a yes, and before I knew he was pounding my vagina. After that, I didn't have a period for about 3 months. He wanted me to suck his penis and I did, but somehow the condom came off. He blew inside my mouth. It was horrifying and he started moaning and groaning. I didn't know what happened, so I climbed out the window, got dressed behind a bush, and ran home. I told nobody.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[...Summer-Rose I don't know if you'll see this comment but...I would say that you were raped. You never actually said "yes" to any of that. He took advantage of your vulnerable position and your silence. He knew you weren't consenting, but what he did know was that you were scared. He knew you were scared and he knew he could take advantage of your fear to do whatever he wanted. He expected sex from you without you actually having said you wanted it. He didn't care about what you wanted at all. I don't call that loss of virginity. I call that rape. 

I don't know how your life or your relationships have been since then, but if you haven't, I think that you should seek some kind of help, or at least someone to talk to. Project Unbreakable is a great place that I think you should check out. It's based in the US, but I'm sure you could send your story to them anyway. It's a good place for people who have similar stories to yours to open up and heal.]]></wp:comment_content>

Long-time contributor <a href="http://havenotebookwilltravel.blogspot.com" target="_blank">MHiggo</a> gave this response to Renee who wrote the First Person <a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/2012/08/first-person-renee-if-you-wait-too-long-youll-be-too-tall-to-ride-and-lifes-tickets-will-run-out/">"If you wait too long, you’ll be too tall to ride, and life’s tickets will run out"</a>
<blockquote>I can empathize with much of this post. It's difficult when life is made to seem like one big party and you don't feel invited -- and it must be doubly so living in "Sin City." Virgins are seen as freaks, and it must take some doing to be considered a freak in Las Vegas.

Telling you to keep your chin up and believe in yourself would just sound hollow and patronizing, but I would ask why you are so convinced your lack of male companionship now means you'll always be so. A person's 20s tend to be among the most dramatic years of change, and I'd wager that anyone intelligent and capable enough to graduate from college at 18 has it within them to adapt and thrive among those changes.

That line about "the carnival doesn't stay in town forever" sounds an awful lot like the old Japanese saying comparing women and Christmas cake–after the 25th, no one wants either. It's just so, so wrong. You're not going to "dry up" if you spend your 20s focusing on being a better you and getting a better idea of what you want out of life instead of using it before you lose it. If anything, that time spent bettering yourself will make you more attractive to the kinds of people you want to attract. Like you said, life is what you make of it.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:  </strong>

I'm a 20 year old female from Ithaca, New York. I'm in my junior year at Hobart and William Smith Colleges studying Social Justice, with minors in Theater and Latin American Studies.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

How I define virginity has changed for me so much to the point that I feel I've 'lost' my virginity multiple times, but still have things I have never experienced thus I am a 'virgin' for. I understand the medical idea of virginity, breaking of the hymen and so forth, but by that notion I may have lost my virginity the first time I used a tampon which was years before I had actual 'sex’ is just kind of silly to me. I consider intercourse to be breaking the virginity seal (hymen), but I know that sex and physical relations come in many forms, not all that require or include penetration, but that, at least under my definition, makes people no longer virgins. Virginity for me is about growing up. It's stepping over a threshold from innocence into adulthood, and sex is a large part of what our culture thinks makes us adults. I don't think that the loss of your virginity automatically makes you an adult, it's simply one thing in a series of events that allows you to view yourself in a different light.

<strong>Tell us your story: </strong>

Well first off let me say that I was desperate, absolutely desperate to lose my virginity. I thought that it had taken longer than average for me to have my first kiss, first date etc. and as I thought I was behind the curve, I wanted to get it over and done with. I thought about sex constantly (gotta love those teenage hormones) and thought that losing my virginity would be like a magical on/off switch that would cure my self-esteem problems and worries about the fact that I didn't have a 'real' boyfriend. I always had a number of friends who were older than me, I had gotten my first kiss from someone 10 years older than me, and in my 17 year old naivete I thought that being considered 'one of the team' made me as mature as 'the rest of the team.'

One night in October, I was hanging out at one of these older friends houses, with a few of his friends who I knew fairly well. We were smoking weed, watching TV, drinking a few beers; not doing anything particularly important. I'd been flirting with this one guy all night, and at some point we found ourselves alone in the room. Everyone else had gone to sleep, or smoke, or passed out, I'm not even sure. We started making out, and then he went down on me. Now understand this, I had only been kissed a handful of times and groped maybe once, but that was it. I had virtually no experience and a lot of pent up sexual frustration. So having a guy go down on me for the first time was beyond amazing. I'd never had an orgasm before, had read about them of course, but hadn't really been able to imagine what it would actually feel like. It felt fucking amazing.

I kept asking him to have sex with me, (thinking that while this was unbelievably good, it wasn't actual sex like I'd been thinking about it). He kept deferring, he knew I was a virgin and didn't want to be the one to lead me into my sexual life. He made me come multiple times between the weed and the late night, and first time having anything down there, it just stands out in my mind as a huge block of time of indescribable pleasure. I kept begging and pleading and finally we did it. Or rather he did, I didn't do all that much, since I wasn't sure what I was supposed to be doing, and was too nervous about doing something wrong. It was kind of a let down. I mean I felt it, but it didn't feel amazing like the oral sex had, it just felt kind of strange. And then it was over.

For a few weeks after that I felt horribly racked with guilt that I didn't feel guilty. I mean I lost my virginity to a friend of a friend on the first friends couch; both of whom were older than me, I was stoned, a little tipsy, and you know what? I didn't care at all. I still don't. I lost my virginity on my own terms, when I wanted to. I wasn't forced or tricked into it, even if others think I was. I wasn't hurt, I was careful, didn't get sick or pregnant. It was simply over. The amount of relief I felt at just having done it was overwhelming.

I've had enough sex since, to know and respect the difference between sex just for the sake of sex with someone you don't know well or at all, and sex with someone you like or love. Sex with someone you care deeply about is extremely special, beautiful even in how it makes you feel. But, at least for me, your first time doesn't have to be this magical expression of love. Losing your virginity is awkward, it feels strange, you don't know if you're doing anything right, or even if you're doing it wrong. I feel lucky that I lost it with someone who knew what they were doing, even if they didn't know me. My society tells me I should feel guilty for how I lost it, but I don't. Not one little bit.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I personally love your story, I was also 20 when I lost my virginity, to a virtual stranger aside from having mutual friends and such. I had been drinking that night as well, but I don't feel any guilt at all. I actually feel weird that I don't have any ping of regret in me. I just frankly don't care, I thought "I am 20 years old I can do what I want, most people my age have already lost theirs, etc, etc." Maybe not the greatest way to lose it, but it doesn't really bother me. Hated that I didn't know what I was doing, but sort of relieved it's over with. I stopped putting the value on virginity I used to, and started to realize it's more of a label than anything. It's just a word to me and I no longer expected to only wait until you loved someone, and at the same time it might have been a good thing I "got it over with" with someone I had no feelings for.]]></wp:comment_content>

If you want to tell your story, go to our <strong><a href="http://www.virginitymovie.com/tell-your-story/">submission form</a></strong></span><span style="color: #660000; font-style: italic;">. We'd love to run it in this blog. </span>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:  </strong>

My name is Claire. I'm 30 (about to be 31), female, and I live in Sydney, Australia.

<strong>How do you define virginity? </strong>

When I learned about sex, I was taught it was between a man and a woman and centered around vaginal penetration.  I was 16 before I realized that there was an option other than heterosexual–talk about sheltered. Even though there must be other definitions, I can't stop thinking of a virgin as someone who has never had a penis in their vagina (or of course put their penis in someone’s vagina).

<strong>Tell us your story:</strong>

I never intended to stay a virgin for so long.  There was no decision, no religious grounds, no anything else; in some ways it would be easier if there was/had been. I've been 'large' for most of my life and it's taken me a long time to feel OK with that.  I never understood why someone would find me attractive, so when asked on a date I would assume they were desperate, dared or insane, none of which appealed to me so I would always say no. In a way, I stayed a virgin only because I never let anyone close enough to form a relationship where I'd want to have sex with them.

I didn't really think about my virginity one way another until about 24 when almost overnight I developed this feeling that I had 'missed the boat.'  Suddenly it went from something I didn't even think about to a source of shame.  I always thought 'how do you explain to someone that you want to wait longer because it's your first time?' Most of my friends thought nothing of casual sex, and I felt so different to them. In the end I decided that I didn't care; I wasn't going to let being a virgin define who I am or how I live my life.  But at 30 (almost 31) everyone around me is getting married and/or having children and I've still never had sex.  In a lot of ways I just want it done, I wish I'd just had a one night stand years ago.

So I decided I needed a plan, I'm NOT making it to 31!  I've been trying everything from dating sites to 'adult-dating' sites. It hasn't been working so I'm hiring an escort for a night.  I haven't chosen one yet, still trawling through the hundreds of them out there, my cut off for deciding is the end of September.

Some will criticize, but I'm comfortable with this choice. My first time will be with someone who knows what they're doing, and who's probably heard it all before.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm a 21-year-old California girl &amp; college student!

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

Up until I had an actual penis inside my vagina, I defined virginity as anything sexual done with another person: Oral sex, fingering, hand jobs, and even phone sex! All of which I have participated in simply to be one of the cool high school girls.

<strong>Tell us your story:</strong>

About a month after my 20th birthday, my sex-craving military boyfriend called it quits. I was devastated but thankful that I stood my ground on NOT letting him take my virginity. Soon after I met an employee next door from where I worked and immediately felt 100% certain he was the man I wanted to have sex with for the first time. Weeks passed and although we've had steamy make out sessions, it never turned into me swiping my V-Card. It took 3, maybe more, nights filled with sexy mood music &amp; candles until his penis finally entered my vagina! The initial process was painful and as the days of sex wore on, my vagina began to really enjoy it!

It has only been a year and a half but I am still SO thankful I didn't give in to that sex-crazed military ex of mine and waited for the man whom I hope to share the rest of my life with.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Tell us about yourself:</strong>

I'm male, 57-years-old, from South Melbourne, Australia.

<strong>How do you define virginity?</strong>

A person who has never had sex.

<strong>Tell us your story:</strong>

Just turned 57, and like all of you, I’m still a virgin and  I’ve never had a real girlfriend either. I’ve found that as I've aged, I’ve tended to lose a fair bit of my inhibition, and have to be careful of (at times) what I say.  I recently came to the conclusion that if an average 14-year-old male came to me and told me he’d had a vision that he would remain a virgin until he was 50, I’d say to him "Have you thought of jumping in front of a fast-moving car?" For someone like myself, I just don’t think it’s worth going through the hell of sexual frustration: I’ve been there too long.  After ending 10 years of chronic anxiety, my libido increased about 8 months ago, and I had to go through it again.

When I was about 16, I fell in love with a fellow (female) student at school.  It was a typical country romance – I’d known her for about 5 years, and we’d grown up together. But even though she knew I loved her, I couldn’t bring myself to tell her; I was too shy, and under a heavy dose of testosterone. She approached me three times, but was never proactive about it and after this, she gave up.  There was no one else, just her.  I never went to dances–don’t like them, and never drank alcohol, so I couldn’t rely on this to lower my inhibitions and increase my confidence.  I just didn’t know what to say to her.  I got to know two other females in the next 7 years or so who I took an interest in and told, but they put me straight into the "friend zone." End of story.

In 1986, I moved from country Australia to the main state city due to a life crisis that would last for more than 20 years. I’d been told by a number of supposedly "wise" people that this would be the best thing to do, and that I’d be "forced" to make new friendships etc. As I’d intuitively felt, it never worked that way.  I consequently became socially isolated, and never really made any friends; picking up females in bars was out of the question.  In 1985, I saw a psychiatrist to obtain advice prior to moving down to the city.  When I asked her advice on trying to get a girlfriend, she made a face and changed the subject immediately.

In 1990, in the city, I sought counseling from a very nice lady who worked for the local council to try to help with my adjustment problems in the city.  When I asked her the same question, she said "You don’t need to to have a sexual relationship." I told her I just wanted a girlfriend, and all she could suggest was that it was easy to meet people by walking dogs in the park.

Feminism has apparently taught females to "have sex like a man," but many don’t seem to realize what they’re missing out on by approaching quiet males and building up their confidence.  I suggest reading JM Kearn’s 2008 classic "Why Mr Right Can’t Find You." I think it explains a great deal.

Until the internet came online, there was, it seems, very little worthwhile information on relationship development.  I still see couples of all ages, and keep thinking "How did they do that?" (form a relationship).]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I also agree that you need to stop putting the responsibility on other people. You blame feminism, you blame the friend zone, etc. etc. But through the whole thing, you keep expecting others to approach you. The perfect partner is not going to just fall into your lap. You have to start approaching people yourself. 

I also think it's a good idea to try online dating. Start a profile, look at people in your own age range. Take the step to e-mail people that match you so you can get to know them. 

And if you're in a state where it's legal, I don't think there would be any shame in you hiring an escort. She could help you get past the hump (pun intended) of your first time and help you relax.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[At what point do you stop blaming other people around you, and start considering that maybe you're the reason why you're not getting laid?

I  understand that it's stressful, alienating, and demoralizing to keep trying to find The One, and failing. I really do. But I also want to point out a few things to people moping about always being in the Friend Zone:

* You do not get to decide whether someone finds you attractive, or likeable. You can influence these things by bathing daily, being interesting and kind, etc, but grousing about being "just friends" is wholly unattractive, and a good reason to be dumped as a friend. Have you ever solicited honest feedback from your friends about your love life? Maybe they know that you come on too strong/smell funny/are annoying, but they have been able to see past these blocks and can help you smooth out your edges.

* If you've only met a handful of people you find attractive, either you're too picky, you're not socializing with the gender(s) you find attractive, or you simply don't have a very high libido or interest in sex. If it's the last one, fine! More power to you. If it's one of the first? Get over your victim complex, because you're perpetuating your problem.

* Being desperate and clingy is such a turnoff. Awkward is great! Desperate? Self-hating? Not so much.

* Be friends with people! Lots of people! Do interesting things! Be open to the idea that someone will ask you out, but you need to stop searching so hard. That just makes you look fucking desperate. Your counselors shouldn't have been so dismissive of your efforts to find someone, but they also should have encouraged this step. My god.

* Alternatively, stop looking at your friends group and look online. Make a nice, honest but not creepy OKCupid profile, and be up front about your desire for a sexual relationship over friendship. Only message people in your own age range, and read a few online dating snark blogs for a while to get a sense of the kind of messages that are not okay.

* Pay a nice lady for her time and willingness to take your V-card. Sex workers can be totally decent people!  Once you've gotten over the hump of Your First Time, then maybe relationships won't be so scary.]]></wp:comment_content>
